   Chief Complaint:  Fevers, hypotension
   HPI:
   37 yo M with a PMH of sinus headaches s/p septal surgery and GERD who
   presented to the ED from clinic with fevers. He reports that he thought
   he had a URI for the last 3-4 days. Then last night he developed high
   fevers and fatigue. Sunday he began feeling as if he had a cold then
   monday began feeling achy this progressed on teusday and then teusday
   night he began having shaking chills and back pain. He went to see his
   PCP's office today. They noted a temperature of 102 and pleuritic chest
   pain and sent him to the ED for further work up because he was so ill
   appearing. He also notes a sore throat and productive cough with clear
   sputum, chills and rigors last night and pleuritic right chest pain. He
   had some nausea and dizziness as well.
   .
   In the ED, his initial vital signs were T 98.9, HR 94, BP 96/54, RR 17,
   O2sat 100. He had a CXR which suggested RLL pneumonia. He was ordered
   for levofloxacin, ceftriaxone and vancomycin as the ED was concerned
   over community acquired MRSA pneumonia given question of preceeding
   viral syndrome. Lactate was elevated to 2.6; therefore, he was given 3L
   NS. However, his BPs continued to drift to the low 90s when IVF were
   stopped. Thus he is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for further managment.
   .
   He denies N/V/D, numbness, tingling, and shortness of breath. He does
   complain of decreased urine output. Review of systems is otherwise
   negative.

Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 37 year old man without significant past medical
history who presents with fever, hypotension, right lower lobe
pneumonia on chest x-ray, now called out of ICU to regular
medical floor.
Patient initially presented with worsening URI symptoms,
fatigue, malaise, cough, fevers/chills, orthostasis, pleuritic
chest pain.  In ED, was febrile, borderline tachycardic, low
blood pressures (SBP low 90's from baseline of low 100's),
lactate 2.6, WBC 25.9.  Chest x-ray demonstrated RLL pneumonia.
Patient was administered 4 liters of NS and admitted to the
intensive care unit.
In the intensive care unit, patient was continued on IV fluid
repletion with resolution of his elevated lactate and
hypotension to baseline BPs.  He was initially started on
Vancomycin, CTX, levofloxacin and transitioned to Vanc, CTX,
azithromycin.  His oxygenation has remained stable in the high
90's on 3L NC.  His WBC has come down to 18.6.  Urine legionella
was sent and is negative.  Blood cultures are no growth to date,
sputum culture contaminated, respiratory viral screen (including
influenza) is preliminarily negative, MRSA screen pending.  LFTs
(including LDH) are within normal limits.
Of note, patient is also noted to have new anemia with Hct 30 ->
26 on admission, decreased from last level of 40 1 year ago (per
discussion wit PCP), with MCV of 70.  Iron studies demonstrate
iron deficiency anemia.  Patient has been started on iron
supplements.  When questioned about this, patient denies any
melena, BRBPR.  Does state that in [**Month (only) 404**] underwent surgery for
deviated septum, and after this surgery had ""horrible"" bloody
noses for 1 week, with a lot of associated blood loss.
Also of note, patient is noted to have elevated INR of 2.1.
Liver enzymes WNL, DIC labs pending.
Currently pt states he feels better than on admission, but
remains slightly achy, getting a fever again currently,
continued cough which is spastic.  Pleuritic chest pain
improved.

*********


Brief Hospital Course:
37 year old man without significant past medical history who
presents with fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, elevated lactate
and right lower lobe pneumonia on chest x-ray, consistent with
sepsis.
.
# Pneumonia/sepsis:  Patient presented with fever, hypoxia,
leukocytosis, elevated lactate, evidence of right lower lobe
pneumonia on chest x-ray.
Was initially admitted to the intensive care unit where he
underwent aggressive volume hydration, was placed on vancomycin,
ceftriaxone and azithromycine.  Urine legionella was negative,
Influenza screen was negative, sputum culture was attempted but
was cancelled as was contaminated with oropharyngeal flora.  The
patient had no HIV risk factors and LDH was normal, making PCP
pneumonia less likely.
With above measures, patient stabilized with resolution of his
hypotension and elevated lactate, WBC trended down, oxygenation
improved and he was transferred to the regular medical floor.
After transfer, the patient was transitioned from vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, azithromycin to levofloxacin.  He was weaned off of
oxygen completely, but remained with dyspnea on exertion and an
ambulatory O2 saturdation was in the high 80's.  His exam and
chest x-ray were consistent with continued right lower lobe
pneumonia as well as small amount of volume overload, felt to be
due to his aggressive IV fluid hydration on presentation.  We
therefore administerd 1 dose of lasix to assist with diuresis.
With above measures, patient improved and was discharged home to
complete a 14 day course of antibiotics, with outpatient follow
up with his primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] note, patient was still having fevers at time of discharge,
but remainder of clinical indicators were improved (including
oxygenation, blood pressure, heart rate, decreased WBC), so felt
he was safe for discharge with close follow up with his primary
care physician.
.
# Leukocytosis:  Presumably due to presenting pneumonia as
above.  Trending down on discharge.
.
# Iron deficiency anemia:  Last Hct = 40 in [**5-2**], on
presentation Hct was 30, low MCV of 68-70, iron studies were
consistent with iron deficiency anemia.  Hemolysis labs were
negative, B12 and folate were normal.  Guiac negative on exam.
In discussion with patient regarding this new anemia, he
described 1 week of profuse epistaxis in [**Month (only) **] following
repair of his septal deviation, which was felt to be the
possible etiology of his iron deficiency (also, patient is a
vegetarian, and therefore possibly unable to increase stores of
iron following the bleeding).  His hematocrit remained stable in
the mid to high 20's during his hospitalization.
Given his history of GERD, he should likely have GI follow up
with possible endoscopy as an outpatient.
He otherwise was started on iron supplementation and should
follow up regarding this issue.
.
# Elevated INR:  Elevated at 2.1 on admission.  DIC labs and
Hemolysis labs were negative.  Patient received 1 dose of
vitamin K, with INR decreasing at time of discharge (at 1.4 at
time of discharge).
.
# GERD: Continued outpatient pantoprazole.

   Assessment and Plan:
   59 y/o M with ESLD secondary to hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents to
   the emergency room today with hematemesis.
   .
   # Hematemesis: has been ""spitting up"" blood the last few days without
   nausea or vomiting.  Likely is from an upper GI source, either
   gastritis vs. varices vs. peptic ulcer disease.  Liver team is
   following.
   - EGD will be post poned as it may be hemoptysis vs. oropharygeal bleed
   - 2 large bore IVs
   - will transfuse more for hct <25 or active bleeding; maintain active
   type and cross
   - protonix IV BID
   - octreotide gtt will be stopped
   - ceftriaxone 1 gm daily for now
   - FFP for INR >2.0 or active bleeding
   - vitamin K now
   - CXR to evaluate for lung abnormality incase the blood is from the
   pulmonary system rather than GI
   .
   # Anemia: has hct of 35 down from baseline of around 40 (although last
   hct was in [**2122-7-8**]).  Could be anemia of chronic disease, from
   upper GI bleed or slow lower GI bleed.
   - add on Fe studies, vit B12, folate
   - EGD as above per liver in future
   - transfuse for Hct <25
   - plan for colonoscopy, likely this admission
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: again unclear etiology, could be secondary to either
   gastritis, peptic ulcer disease or potentially SBP.
   - EGD as above
   - ceftriaxone 1 gm daily
   - diagnostic paracentesis per liver team
   - ultrasound liver with dopplers in AM
   .
   # Ascites: is slowly reaccumulating ascites since last admission one
   week ago per patient and his brother.  Is on lasix and aldactone at
   home and has been compliant.
   - hold lasix/aldactone in setting of possible bleeding; restart in AM
   - diagnostic para to r/o SBP
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: having worsening liver disease with rising
   INR, increasing ascites and decreasing albumin.
   - supportive care with treatments as above
   - AFP normal yesterday, continue to trend as outpatient
   - liver US with dopplers tomorrow
   .
   # Back Pain: chronic in nature, stable excpet has not been receiving
   his PO medications today.  Continue to hold PO meds.
   - morphine IV PRN
   - consider advancing to clears
   .

EGD [**4-5**]:
Unable to intubate the esophagus secondary to patient agitation
and discomfort. Unable to increase sedatives secondary to
hypotension to 70's. Responded to 1.5 L fluid bolus. Patient
currently stable. NPO after midnight. EGD tomorrow under MAC
anesthesia.
.
EGD [**4-6**]:
Small AVM at GE junction
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal
junction
Erythema, congestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance
in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive
gastropathy
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: grade I esophageal varices. Not large enough to
band. Portal hypertensive gastropathy. Please continue current
management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 31469**] is a 59 year old man with ESLD secondary to hepatitis
C cirrhosis who presented with an episode of
hemoptysis/hematemesis. He was initially admitted to the ICU out
of concern for ongoing bleeding. His hematocrit remained stable.

.
# Hematemesis/Hemoptysis: Unclear initially if episodes of
hemoptysis or hematemesis. Then, patient clarified episode as
hemoptysis (no vomiting, just coughed up blood gob). He has a
history of varices requiring banding. Hct drifted down slightly
but then stable throughout hospitalization. [**Hospital1 **] PPI. Attempted
EGD on [**4-5**], but patient hypotensive with increased sedation
needed to prevent gagging. As such, procedure did not occur. On
[**4-6**] patient sedated with general anesthesia and underwent EGD.
No evidence of active bleed, and no varices requiring banding.
Patient tolerated EGD well, was feeling well after procedure
ended. Discharged later that day.
Given GI was not believed to be source of hemoptysis, set-up
patient with pulmonologist appointment and CT scan of the chest;
this was explained to patient. There is obviously concern for
malignancy in smoker, 59 y/o male, and we feel this needs a
pulmonary work-up with imaging and specialist investigation.
Patient and pulmonologist aware of need for imaging and
appointment.
.
# Abdominal Pain: Resolved. No evidence of SBP.
.
# Fatigue: Likely due to anemia, hypotension, cirrhosis.
Monitored, keen to go home.

# Ascites: Restarted furosemide and spironolactone.
.
# Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: Continue current treatment of
furosemide, nadolol, and spironolactone.
.
# Back Pain: Chronic and stable. Oxycodone - home regimen.
.
# ?COPD: Patient without reported history of COPD but on
inhalers at home. Continue home medications
.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent


Discharge Instructions:
Thank you for allowing us to take part in your care. You were
admitted to the hospital with bleeding. There was a concern that
you may have been bleeding from varices in your esophagus. You
underwent an EGD or endoscopy with anesthesia which used a
camera to look at your esophagus and stomach. This did not show
bleeding; it only showed very small varices that need to be
monitored every 6 months. Your blood counts remained stable
while you were in the hospital.

You will need to follow up with a pulmonary (lung) doctor to
make sure that the blood you coughed up was not coming from your
lungs. Before going to the appointment with the pulmonologist on
[**5-7**], please have a CT scan done at [**Hospital1 18**], at your convenience.
It is important that they have the results of the CT scan when
you go to the appointment with the lung doctor, so that they can
take care of you.

We made no changes to your medications. Please continue your
home medications as prescribed.

Followup Instructions:
Because you coughed up blood, we would like you to have your
lungs examined. Please go to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Radiology to have
a CT scan (please call the attached phone # first, to schedule
an appointment for the scan). Also, please go to the following
important appointment at the Pulmonary (Lung) clinic:
[**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**5-7**] at 8:30AM; [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building, [**Location (un) 436**],
Medical specialties. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**]. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 612**].
Please have the CT scan done before the appointment so that its
results can be used to guide your care.

   cardiomyopathy now resolved (EF >55% 9/09) who presents with diarrhea
   and hypotension.
   .
   Patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 11145**] and treated with c. diff
   colitis.  She was initially treated with IV flagyl and po vanco, but
   was discharged on a 14 day course of po vanco (last day [**12-7**]).  The
   patient was also on TPN via a PICC line that was d/c during that
   admission over concern for infection, although the culture remained
   negative.  She also underwent a paracentesis that showed >250 polys,
   but GI felt it was reactive in the setting of pancolitis and not SBP.
   She was not treated with additional antibiotics and cultures returned
   no growth.
   In the ED, the patient arrived with SBP in the 60s and emergent right
   femoral line was placed and she was started on levophed.  She was
   mentating and reported diarrhea, weakness and increased thrist.  Her
   stools were initially guaiac positive and she was given 1U pRBC, Hct
   returned 33 and no additional blood procducts were given. She was given
   4L NS and intubated for agitation and mild respiratory distress (CMV,
   Vt:450, PEEP 5, RateL 18, FiO2 100%).  Her blood pressures improved to
   105/64 on 0.09mcg/kg/min of levophed, but with HR 134.  She underwent
   CT-scan of abd/pelvis that showed bibasilar opacities, small [**Last Name (un) 11146**],
   and unchaged wall thickening consistent with pancolitis.  Her lactate
   was 3.7 and she was ordered for flagyl, IV vanco, and zosyn.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 18036**] had been admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with C. difficile
pancolitis from [**Date range (1) 31488**] and discharged home at that time
on PO vancomycin. She represented to the ED on [**12-25**] with
headache and weakness and decompensated, requiring intubation
and pressors. She was initially admitted to the MICU but then,
after consultation with ID, GI, Medicine, Surgery, and the MICU,
it was decided to take her to the operating room for total
abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy. She was kept intubated
for 4 days and extubated on [**12-29**], and transferred to the floor a
day later. She recovered on the floor slowly but surely and was
finally discharged home on [**2103-1-15**] to complete another 7 days of
flagyl. The rest of her stay is summarized below by system.

Neuro: In addition to her chronic back pain, Mrs. [**Known lastname 18036**] had
the addition of the new pain from the operation. She was started
on methadone standing and dilaudid prn and her pain control is
being given over to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **]. By the time of discharge,
her pain was well controlled on this regimen.

CV: Upon admission she required pressor support and significant
resuscitation for her sepsis, which continued after she went to
the OR. She was monitored in the ICU with a Swan-Ganz catheter
and was given fluids, blood products, derivatives, and pressors
as needed. She underwent echocardiography on [**12-28**] which showed a
LVEF of 70% and otherwise normal function except for new
moderate PA hypertension. Pressors were weaned appropriately and
she was able to be transferred to the floor where she remained
hemodynamically stable. Vital signs were monitored regularly.

Pulm: She was intubated in the ED and remained so until [**12-29**]
when she was finally weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
After extubation, she was weaned off oxygen appropriately and
left the hospital on room air.

GI/GU: She was quite surprised on awakening that she had a new
ostomy and this will require a long time for her to adjust. An
ostomy/wound care nursing consult was obtained and the ostomy
was changed regularly and monitored for signs of breakdown. By
the end of her hospital stay, Mrs. [**Known lastname 18036**] was becoming slowly
more comfortable managing her ostomy, but still required nursing
help. Due to the antibiotic received throughout her stay, she
began to develop a vaginal yeast infection which was treated
with fluconazole.

F/E/N: Electrolytes and fluids were monitore during her stay.
She received appropriate repletion when necessary. Tube feeds
were started on [**12-27**], but not continued for long. She was
started on TPN on [**12-28**] and continued on that until [**1-2**]. Her diet
was advanced appropriately to a bariatric stage V diet. She was
not taking in enough orally however to meet her needs, thus tube
feeds were started through her gastric remnant. The patient
complained of being stuck to the IV pole while getting tube
feeds and ultimately refused further feedings until it was
suggested that she take the tube feeds as boluses. The patient
learned how to do this herself and was ultimately much happier
with this arrangement, giving herself four cans of replete with
fiber daily. She was discharged home with qid tube feeds and a
regular diet.

Heme: The patient was coagulopathic upon presentation due to her
sepsis and required in total 6 units of packed RBCs, 6 units of
FFP, 2 cryoprecipitates, and 11 vials of albumin for repletion
of cofactors, treatment of her coagulopathy, anemia, and sepsis.
As she normalized following her operation, she no longer
required further products.

ID: The patient was put on PO vanc and IV flagyl on admission as
well as variably cefepime, zosyn, and tigecycline. After
discharge from the unit, the patient was maintained on
vancomycin and flagyl and eventually the vancomycin was dc'd.
Her flagyl was transitioned to po and she was discharged on a 7
day course of flagyl. Her wound started to show some breakdown
inferiorly and [**4-5**] staples were removed on [**1-6**] and a wound
culture sent. For this she was started on unasyn, which was
continued for a short course. On the day before discharge,
another few staples were removed above the umbilicus with some
serous drainage. The patient refused removal of further staples
at that time and it was decided that the wound could be
monitored for a little longer.

Psych: The patient has baseline depression and anxiety and this
was exacerbated by the long and difficult hospital course as
well as by the surprise finding, upon wakening, that she no
longer had a colon and would have to pass stool through an
ostomy for at least a number of months. These stressors were
difficult for her and she had a tough time with acclimating
herself to the idea. She initially refused to work with the
ostomy nurse but later showed some willingness to start taking
over some of the ostomy care herself. She was seen by psych
consult in house who thought that the anxiety component was much
more prevalent and recommended treatment with benzodiazepines.
She was discharged with a short prescription for ativan and will
follow up with her PCP for further management of her pain and
anxiety.

   Respiratory Virus Identification (Final [**2106-3-29**]):
      POSITIVE FOR RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS (RSV).
         Viral antigen identified by immunofluorescence.
Blood Cx [**2106-3-28**]: Negative
.
IMAGING:
CXR [**2106-3-28**]: FINDINGS: A single bedside radiograph of the chest
excludes the lateral most portions of the left lung from the
field of view. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
unremarkable. Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion is seen
without focal consolidation.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No focal
consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
64-year-old man with COPD, CAD, HTN here with several days of
shortness of breath, productive coughs, fever, most likely COPD
exacerbation in the setting of an infection.
.
# COPD exacerbation: Patient was on BiPAP initially but quickly
weaned to 5L NC, breathing comfortably. ABG 7.35/59/64 suggested
chronic respiratory acidosis.  He  was given standing albuterol
nebs q2h, standing ipratropium nebs q6h, prednisone 40 mg qday.
He was initially treated with empiric levofloxacin and
ceftriaxone given requirement for ICU admission.  However,
nasopharyngeal aspirate demonstrated RSV, which was more likely
the trigger.  Thus, antibiotics were stopped.  His breathing and
cough improved significantly over the next several days, and he
was discharged home with supplemental oxygen.  He was also given
a prednisone taper and instructed to start spiriva as well as
advair.  Smoking cessation counseling was provided and the
patient started on a nicotine patch.  He was instructed to
follow-up in pulmonary clinic after discharge.
.
# RSV infection: Initially treated with empiric antibiotics for
CAP, which were stopped when respiratory viral antigen returned
positive for RSV.  He was treated symptomatically with
supplemental oxygen and anti-tussive agents, as well as
prednisone and nebulizers for COPD as above.
.
# CAD s/p PCI in [**2098**]:  The patient was started on ASA 81 mg
daily.
.
# HTN:  HCTZ was continued.
.
# Anxiety: Diazepam and trazodone qhs were continued.
.
# GERD: Continued on home regimen of omeprazole.

# Cystinuria: Diagnosed at age 19, with history of multiple
kidney stones.  During this admission, the patient reported
intermittent right groin pain consistent with his pain from

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 yo male with a history of T1DM s/p cadoveric
renal transplant, chronic RLE ulcers, and IVC filter on
coumadin, who was admitted with DKA in the setting of one week
of N/V, diarrhea and fevers.

#. DKA: Thought [**12-31**] infection (MRSA bacteremia and C diff
colitis found in workup)  He received aggressive IVF and IV
insulin bolus but no gtt.  His gap closed overnight in the ICU.
EKG without signs of active ischemia.  He was restarted on his
home insulin regimen once gap closed, with no further incidents.

#. R FOOT ULCER/CELLULITIS: was previously treated with
linezolid and followed by podiatry as out-patient; seen by
[**Month/Day (2) 1106**] and podiatry on admission.  He was started on vanco and
unasyn on admission, and this was narrowed to just vanco after
his culture data returned.  Initial wound swab grew MRSA and was
the likely source of MRSA bacteremia. He underwent debridement
in OR by podiatry on [**2136-5-31**], cultures sent from OR and also grew
MRSA. ID consulted and suggested 6 weeks vancomycin: his wound
probes to bone so there was certainly concern for osteomyelitis.
Pathology eventually confirmed acute osteomyelitis. He will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31564**] of podiatry.

#  MRSA BACTEREMIA:  [**12-31**] sets on admission.  Source likely foot
ulcer.  TTE negative.  Surveillance blood cultures neg to date.
Treating with 6 weeks vancomycin as above.

#. NAUSEA/VOMITING, DIARRHEA, C DIFF COLITIS:  sx improved with
appropriate tx with flagyl. Will be treated with 2 weeks Flagyl
and if diarrhea recurs while on vancomycin, will consider
retreating with Flagyl.

#. SOB: sx resolved without further intervention.  No signs ACS
or pneumonia.  Low suspicion PE.  No hypoxia

#. Right knee pain: There was initially significant concern for
possible septic knee in the setting of MRSA bacteremia; however
on further evaluation by rheum, they reported that he had no
effusion, no fluid for arthrocentesis.  Their differential
included CPPD/crystalline disease, other musculoskeletal such as
meniscal tear, avascular necrosis (chronic steroids), occult
fracture. MRI showed no evidence of meniscal or ligamentous
injury, non-specific circumferential subcutaneous edema, and
only trace joint fluid. His pain improved with conservative
management.

#. Coagulopathy: INR 20 on presentation likely [**12-31**] diarrhea and
poor PO intake over last week; received 1 unit FFP in the ED as
well as vitamin K.  INR improved to 6.  We held coumadin but
also gave no further vitamin K in the ICU. His INR was allowed
to drift down and was 3.7 on discharge. He will follow up with
[**Hospital3 **] who will determine when he will restart
coumadin.

#. ARF: Cr 2.1 on admission; with IVF in ED.  Likely prerenal as
it improved with appropriate hydration.  Continued
prednisone/prograf for renal allograft. On resumption of his
outpatient diuretics, his creatinine started rising again.
Diuretics were held as urine lytes suggested this was again
prerenal. Given his worsening lower extremity edema and after
his creatinine had stabilized around 1.7-1.8, Lasix was
restarted at 40mg qd and florinef was stopped.

#. Hx heavy EtOH use: ciwa scale and mvi/folate/thiamine; no
signs withdrawal so CIWA discontinued.

# T1 DM, uncontrolled with complications:  as above, DKA
resolved with appropriate insulin IV in ICU and tx of multiple
infections.

# CAD s/p CABG: continued ASA, Plavix

# Anemia: he was guaiac negative and iron studies were
consistent with ACD. Procrit was started in-house, to be
continued as an outpatient.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1873**] is a 75 year old male with recent hemorrhagic stroke, HTN,
   BPH, HL, admitted for bilateral PE.
   .
   1. PE.  Recent hemorrhagic stroke on [**2186-8-22**] makes anticoagulation a
   concerning choice.  Spoke with [**Date Range 1874**] who feel that anticoagulation
   is only a relative contraindication to anticoagulation given that the
   hemorrhagic stroke occured two months ago, however, the risks of
   anticoagulation are high in this patient.  Will likely need family
   meeting with PCP involvement to reach an agreement re:
   anticoagulation.  Will pursue IVC filter tonight.  Currently
   hemodyamically stable.  Pa02 of 173 on 100%[**Last Name (LF) 1351**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will titrate down
   oxygen.  Etiology of PE likely secondary to prolonged immobility; no
   history of malignancy or prior clots.
   - titrate supplemental oxygen
   - IVC filter placement
   - discuss with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1874**], family, re: risks & benefits of systemic
   anticoagulation in this patient
   - echo to evaluate biventricular function
   - [**Name10 (NameIs) 1874**] consult re: whether anticoagulation is possible in this
   patient
   - r/o MI
   .
   2. H/o CVA.  History of hemorrhagic and ischemic CVA with minimal
   residual deficits.  Will pursue head imaging tonight given that
   systemic anticoagulation remains a possibility in this patient.  Will
   consult [**Name10 (NameIs) 1874**] re: anticoagulation in this patient.
   - neuro consult
   - head ct w/o contrast
   .
   2.  HTN.  History of hemorrhagic stroke, so will aim to maintain SBP <
   140.
   - continue lisinopril, felodipine

[**10-17**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

[**10-17**] LENIS: IMPRESSION: Acute deep venous thrombosis within the
left distal superficial
femoral vein and extending into the popliteal and posterior
tibial veins as
described. No deep venous thrombosis of the right lower
extremity.

[**10-18**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast with maneuvers. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal systolic function. Findings consistent
with pulmonary emboli. No ASD or PFO identified.

[**10-17**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with frequent premature beats, probably
atrial premature beats
with aberrant conduction. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2186-8-21**] rhythm is similar, T wave
inversions in
leads V1-V3 are now present. Cannot exclude ischemia.

[**10-18**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No evidence of recent hemorrhage.
Subtle hyperattenuation in
region of prior left basal ganglia/internal capsule parenchymal
hemorrhage.

Foot XRay: IMPRESSION: Soft tissue swelling. No fracture
identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 31611**] is a 75 year old male with recent
hemorrhagic stroke, HTN, BPH, HL, admitted for bilateral PE and
LLE DVT.
.
Pulmonary Embolism. Patient found to have bilateral central PEs
and LLE DVT.  IVC filter placed and anticoagulation with heparin
initiated in spite of recent hemorrhagic stroke (2 months ago)
after discussion with neurology who recommended anticoagulation.
 Patient remained hemodyamically stable and was weaned off
supplemental oxygen during hospital stay.   Echo showed evidence
of RV strain and he was found to have elevated BNP on admission.
 Etiology of PE likely secondary to prolonged immobility; no
history of malignancy or prior clots. He was bridged to Coumadin
prior to discharge and had therapeutic INR for 2 days prior to
discontinuation of heparin drip.
.
H/o CVA.  History of hemorrhagic and ischemic CVA with minimal
residual deficits.  He was followed by neurology during hospital
stay.  Head CT on admission showed no acute event.
.
HTN. Patient continue on lisinopril and felodipine.
.
BPH.  S/p turp.  He was continued on finasteride.
.
Hyperlipidemia.  He was continued on ezetemibe and simvastatin.
.
Left foot/toe pain: Pt c/o pain over dorsum of left foot/toes.
He did not have any focal tenderness or erythema. XR only showed
soft tissue swelling and no fracture. He had edema in left foot,
likely [**1-14**] DVT. He was given 0.5 tab Vicodin with good effect as
needed for toe pain in hospital which was improved at time of
discharge.

   ECG: NSR @91, no acute st/t changes. No change compared to prior
   [**2133-8-25**].
   .
   ECHO [**2133-8-19**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
   leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular cavity sizes
   with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
   Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation.
   .
   Imaging:
   CXR: low lung volumes, interval opacification of left lung layering
   pleural effusion vs lobar collapse; right lung demonstrates patchy
   airspace opacity concerning for PNA. Streaky opacity in right mid lung
   may be consistent w/atelactasis.
   CTA chest(wet read): Confluent ground-glass opacity in both lungs in
   similar pattern to [**2133-8-17**]. Most likely atypical pneumonia given
   fever, but drug reaction, pulmonary hemorrhage are additional
   considerations.
   CT C-spine(wet read): No fracture. C1 right-rotated (clockwise) upon
   C2, likely positional given patient was moving on scanner. If concern
   for rotary subluxation could repeat.
   CT head: No hemorrhage, edema, or change since [**2133-4-17**].
   .
   MRI [**2134-2-5**]:IMPRESSION: Multiple nonenhancing T2 hyperintense lesion in
   the subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter as well as
   lesions in the corpus callosum and the left cerebellar hemisphere. The
   findings are likely the result of a demyelinating process such as
   multiple sclerosis.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: PT is a 53 y.o woman with h.o MS, asthma, chronic pain who
   presents with SOB/cough/ fever s/p fall.
   .
   #SOB/respiratory distress: Likely a result of infection given CT and
   CXR findings, opacification of the L.lung(effusion vs.collapse),
   R.lung with patchy airspace opacity. CT findings of ground glass
   opacities in both lungs suggesting atypical pneumonia. Per CT read,
   other possibilites include drug rxn, pulm hemorrhage. However, given
   fever infection more likely. In terms of sources of infection,
   considerations include bacterial, viral such as influenza, or less
   likely fungal PCP (however LDH elevated)-given immunosuppression MS tx.
   Other less likely possibilies include fluid overload from cardiac
   causes (however last echo with perserved function, BNP 1300).
   Malignancy also a possibility. Given history of asthma and MS will have
   to be mindful of pt's respiratory status. PE also in differential,
   however imaging findings and clinical exam not suggestive at this time.

CTA [**10-1**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or dissection.
2. Multifocal confluent airspace opacities, left lung greater
than right. The pattern is similar to [**2133-8-17**], and the
differential diagnosis includes atypical pneumonia, aspiration.
Less likely etiologies of pulmonary hemorrhage and drug reaction
are also possibilities.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 y.o woman with h.o MS, asthma, chronic pain who presents with
SOB/cough/ fever s/p fall.
.
# Atypical vs CAP: She presented with dyspnea on [**10-1**]. CT and
CXR of lung showed opacification of the left lung (effusion
vs.collapse), and right lung with patchy airspace opacity. CT
findings of ground glass opacities in both lungs suggested
atypical pneumonia. On [**10-3**], she was started on
Methylprednisolone 60 Q 8 and given lasix 20 IV x 1. Pt
continued to have worsening dyspnea and was intubated on [**10-3**]
until [**10-6**]. Pt's abx was broadened to Zosyn for 5 days and
after extubation, she was placed on Levaquin again by ICU to
finish a 7 day course of abx. ON floor, pt continued to have
productive cough but oxygen requirement is stable at 0 liters
and has remained afebrile. Pt finished levaquin on [**2134-10-10**]. For
ongoing cough, pt is on frequent nebs, guaifenisen, prn
suctioning and also ordered for chest PT.
.
# S/P Fall: She had a fall with no available history for
pre/post symptoms to suggest syncope from vasovagal,
orthostatic, or cardiac cause. Pt remembers the fall and she
denies pre-syncopal/syncopal sx. She thinks she tripped. She has
an L eyelid superficial lac which was steri-stripped in ICU.  CT
head and C spine are negative.

# Altered Mental Status: Pt appeared delerious upon admission.
It was believe that the pt was AOx3 at baseline, however had
been noted to be suffering from hallicinations/paranoia prior to
admission. DDx included infection, narcotic intake (although tox
negative), toxic metabolic. Pt is s/p fall but CT head/neck
negative for acute process. Following extubation on [**10-6**], the
patient's mental status cleared and she was subsequently AOx3 on
the morning of [**10-8**] and has continued to remain oriented and
calm on floor.
.
# advanced MS (multiple sclerosis). Neurology was consulted for
help on medical management, they recommended continuing all her
MS meds but they were inaccurately dosed in ICU. Home meds
reconciled with husband on [**10-9**] and except for soma, pt is on
all of her MS meds again as of [**10-9**].

# Chronic Pain: Per husband, pt is on oxycontin 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Pt
continued on Oxycontin 20mg [**Hospital1 **] here with prn oxycodone and
appeared to be doing well.

# Diarrhea - in ICU. Stool studies sent when came to floor.
Cdiff X 1 neg. Cdiff X 2 pending. Stool cx ordered. She was
started on flagyl for 14 days for high clinical suspecion.

        [image002.jpg]
   Imaging: [**11-6**] CT Abdomen (wet read):
   Colonic wall thickening. In the setting of cirrhosis and ascited some
   component of mural edema is not excluded, though, given the provided
   symptoms,
   this more likely reflects colitis. Infiltration of the omentum is also
   noted.
   Would recommend a repeat evaluation with contrast on a non-emergent
   basis
   when the patient is better able to tolerate contrast.
   [**2119-11-6**] PORTABLE CXR (wet read): Low lung volumes. Limited evaluation.
   Lungs appear clear bilaterally. No large pleural effusion or
   pneumothorax. No acute findings on chest radiograph.
   [**2119-10-13**] EGD: Abnormal mucosa in the stomach
   Normal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy)
   Varices at the lower third of the esophagus
   Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
   .
   [**2119-10-13**] Colonoscopy: Preparation was adequate to the splenic flexure.
   From the splenic flexure to the hepatic flexure the preparation was
   fair. The scope was not traversed passed the hepatic flexure because
   the preparation was poor. No abnormalities noted. There was some
   bleeding after the biopsies were obtained but hemostasis was
   successfully achieved. (biopsy)
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
   Otherwise normal colonoscopy to hepatic flexure

   # Diarrhea/Abdominal pain: Patient has had worsening abdominal pain for
   3 days, though diarrhea for one week, and similar symptoms on admission
   1 month prior. At that time, work up including EGD, colonoscopy
   (including biopsies), and stool studies were negative. CT abdomen
   concerning for colitis. Most likely source of abdominal pain with
   fevers and ascites is SBP.  Differential for diarrhea includes CMV
   colitis, cryptosprodium, microspora, cyclospora, C diff colitis,
   giardia, and bacterial etiologies. Patient had negative CMV viral load
   on last hospitalization on [**2119-10-10**]. Non infectious causes may be
   diarrhea secondary to lactulose.
   -consider paracentesis in the morning after correcting coagulopathy
   -send stool O+P, C diff studies
   -send CMV viral load
   -Cipro and Flagyl for coverage for colitis and SBP
   -f/u final read of CT abdomen
   -liver consulted -follow up recs regarding need for EGD and colonoscopy
   -trend lipase, clinically does not appear to have pancreatitis.
   -NPO until final read of CT abdomen obtained
   .
   # Subjective Fevers: most likely source is abdomen. CT concerning for
   colitis on wet read. CXR clear. Patient denies SOB or cough. No
   dysuria. No evidence of altered mental status or meningeal signs.
   -see above
   -UA, UCx
   -f/u blood cultures from ED
   -panculture if spikes
   .
   # Hypotension: BPs 80s/40s on admission to ED. Currently 89/47. Likely
   hypovolemic secondary to poor po intake. Given subjective fevers,
   septic physiology is a possibility. Currently responding well to IV
   fluids. See above for work up for fevers.
   -IV fluid boluses overnight to maintain MAP>55
   .
   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K) with concurrent AIDS. Patient
   reports that he has been compliant with his medications. Now has
   coagulopathy, secondary to severe liver disease.
   -continue lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 9723**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] outpatient regimen
   -continue nadolol for known varices
   -hold lasix and spironolactone given acute renal failure
   -f/u hepatology recs
   -plan for paracentesis in the AM
   -po vitamin K tonight
   .
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 65, VL<48K in [**2119-10-31**]. Patient reports compliance with
   medications with the exception of 1 day PTA.
   - continue outpatient HAART regimen
   - azithro and bactrim PPX restarted
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine 4.4, was 0.6 one week ago. Appears
   hypovolemic. Likely secondary to poor po intake. Differential includes
   HIV nephropathy and hepatorenal syndrome.
   -trial of IV fluids tonight
   .
   # HCT drop: HCT 27.6, 32.6 one week prior. Had guaiac positive brown
   stool in ED, and subjective melena at home. Patient has known
   esophageal varices and hemorrhoids.
   -monitor HCT q 8h
   -transfuse for HCT<24
   -active T&S

of the left internal jugular central venous line tip is at the
cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
Interval improvement with clearing of the right lower lung;
stable airspace opacities in the right upper lobe most likely
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 42 year old man with AIDS and HCV with
decompensated cirrhosis who presented on [**11-6**] with fevers and
abdominal pain with hypotension requiring ICU admission.
.
* Goal of care
Given the patient's end stage liver disease and advanced AIDS,
the palliative care service was consulted. In discussion with
the patient and his family the decision was reached to make him
DNR/DNI and comfort measures only. He will be treated with
anxiolytics and pain medications as needed.
.
* Hypotension
Likely due to volume depletion and possible sepsis. Improved
with IVF resuscitation and antibiotics.
.
* Fever, possible SBP
Patient underwent a therapeutic paracentesis complicated by
bleeding (Hct 8%). A component of SBP could not be absolutely
excluded therefore he was treated empirically with ceftriaxone.
CMV assay showed detectable virus, but at a very low level (<600
copies, below limits of assay to quantify) and was felt to most
likely be a false positive.
.
* AIDS
Patient had supressed viral load, with poor immunologic
recovery. After being made CMO, his antiretrovirals and
prophylactic antimicrobials were discontinued.
.
* HCV cirrhosis
He was continued on lactulose and rifaximin for management of
encephalopathy. Once made CMO, his nadolol was discontinued. He
may undergo therapeutic paracentesis if required for symptomatic
relief with his large ascites.
.
* Acute renal failure
Likely pre-renal on presentation, with ATN in setting of
hypotension. With his tense ascites abdominal compartment
syndrome was a consideration, as was hepatorenal syndrome given
possible SBP. Further workup was deferred once he was made CMO.

Discharge Instructions:
You came into the hospital because of fever and abdominal pains.
Because your blood pressure was low, you were treated in the
intensive care unit. You had a procedure called a paracentesis
to examine the fluid in your abdomen. You were treated for a
possible infection of this fluid. Upon further discussion with
you and your family, a decision was reached to avoid further
aggressive medical care and focus on your comfort, with
discharge to hospice.
.
Please let your doctors know if [**Name5 (PTitle) **] are in pain, and we will
make every effort to improve your comfort.

Followup Instructions:

   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: [**Age over 90 52**] yo M w/ CHF, CAD s/p CABG in [**2137**],
   with LIMA->LAD, SVG->PDA, SVG->PLB, SVG->RI, with CABG RI revision in
   [**2147**], s/p pacemaker for sick sinus and s/p St. Jude's valve for AVR who
   presented to the ED with worsening SOB, chest pain x 2 days. Of note,
   pt intubated/sedated and history primarily obtained by patient's
   sister-in-law who is the de facto HCP (not official). The patient's
   wife was currently unable to provide a history at the time. The
   patient's sister-in-law describes the patient feeling increasingly
   short of breath and feverish (no temperature recorded at home). She
   notes that when the patient becomes fluid overloaded, he typically
   develops a cough with respiratory distress, however, this time no cough
   or sputum either. The patient was also complaining of chest pain x 1
   day, which unfortunately cannot be further delineated based on this
   limited history. The patient's sister-in-law also notes the patient has
   been consuming a high sodium diet. She denies sick contacts, recent
   travel, sweats, chills, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, constipation,
   black/red stools, headaches, back pain, abdominal pain. Because of
   worsening respiratory distress, the patient asked his wife to call EMS.
   .
   In the ED, initial vitals were 97.1   150/94   87   32  and 80s on RA.
   He occasionally dipped to 70s. The patient was later found to be
   hypertensive to 222/94. The patient was then placed on a nitro gtt. The
   patient's CXR revealed pulmonary edema and was given Lasix 40mg IV ONCE
   and made 400cc of urine. The patient remained hypoxic. Bipap was
   attempted without success. ABG revealed 7.39/54/326. The patient was
   successfully intubated after one pass and CXR confirmed proper
   placement. The patient subsequently dropped his pressures to 93/38 and
   was given a 500cc bolus. Unfortunately, a medication reconciliation
   sheet was not available. Per report and OMR, he was also given
   ceftriaxone 1gm IV ONCE, levofloxacin 750mg IV ONCE, ASA 600mg PR ONCE.
   The patient was also given albuterol/ipratropium nebs x 2, midazolam
   2mg/2ml/fentanyl 100mcg/2mL ONCE for sedation.
   .
   The patient arrived to the floor seeming to be breathing synchronously
   with the ventilator. He did not appear in acute distress. He nodded
   afirmative to pain, but could not specify where.
   No overnight events.

   Imaging: 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2154-10-23**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
   prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and
   transvalvular gradients. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
   of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Normally functioning aortic prosthesis. Mild symmetric LVH
   with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function.
   Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-1-15**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.
   .
   CARDIAC CATH [**2149-8-4**]:
   1. Selective coronary arteriography of this right dominant system
   revealed angiographic evidence of three vessel native coronary artery
   disease. The LMCA was diffusely disease up to 50%. The LAD was totally
   occluded in the proximal segment. The CFX had diffuse disease up to 60%
   and gave origen to a 70% lesion in the first obtuse marginal branch.
   The RCA had diffuse disease up to 80% with serial lesions throghout its
   course. The distal PDA and PLB fill [**Last Name (un) 12016**] patent SVG.
   2. Graph angiography showed patent LIMA->LAD, SVG->PDA, SVG->PLB,
   SVG->RI.
   3. Left ventriculography was not performed due to the presence of a
   prosthetic aortic valve.
   4. Hemodynamic evaluation showed normal right and left heart filling
   pressures with a preserved cardiac index calculated by Fick using an
   assumed O2 consumption.
   .
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Patent LIMA->LAD, SVG->PDA, SVG->PLB, SVG->RI.
   3. Normal right and left heart filling pressures.
   ECG: EKG: Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response with
   RBBB and LAD c/w LAFB. Also TW inversions and ST depressions in
   anterolateral precordial leads, most c/w expected ST changes in setting
   of RBBB but cannot exclude ischemia.

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, CP, fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal echocardiogram

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old Russian-speaking male with h/o CHF, CAD s/p CABG in
[**2137**] and revision in [**2147**], PPM for sick sinus s/p replacement 6
weeks ago and AS s/p [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] who presented to the ED with worsening
SOB, chest pain x 2 days.

He was increasingly short of breath with fevers.  He denied
cough but complained of chest pain x 1 day.  He also had
reportedly been consuming a high sodium diet.

In the ED, he had O2 sats in the 80's and was placed on BiPap,
nitro gtt and given Lasix.  He remained hypoxic and was
intubated.  He was also reportedly given ceftriaxone,
levofloxacin and ASA.  He was then admitted to the CCU and
continued diuresis.  There was some question of whether he had a
pneumonia on CXR and he was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin.  Blood cultures grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas and
his Abx were changed to cefepime and azithro.  He also complains
of pain at the pacer site.  He has had negative Cks and
troponins.  ECG showed paced rhythm with ""memory T waves"" per
CCU team.  He was extubated yesterday without complication.

Today he states he remembers feeling SOB at home and had pain at
his pacer site.  Cannot give the timeframe of his symptoms.
Also endorses chest pain.  States he does not remember coming to
the hospital and ""must have lost consciousness.""  Now he denies
SOB, cough, urinary symptoms.  Endorses abdominal pain due to
constipation and complains his home regimen is not being given
to him.  He also endorses left-sided chest pain, worse with
inspiration.

Past Medical History:

Studies:

[**2155-5-7**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a single ventricularly
paced beat. Right bundle-branch block and left anterior
fascicular block. Non-specific precordial T wave inversions may
be related to the right bundle-branch block. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2155-3-28**] native rhythm is now seen

[**2155-5-7**] Chest Xray: 1. Suboptimal study due to patient motion
and a repeat is suggested.  2. Relative mild haziness of the
right lung fields may relate to patient motion, although
interstitial edema or infectious process cannot be excluded.
Possible minimal right pleural effusion.

[**2155-5-9**] KUB: No evidence of bowel obstruction.

[**2155-5-12**] Ankle Xray: In comparison with the study of [**2154-12-27**],
there is no interval change. Extensive vascular calcification is
again consistent with diabetes.  No evidence of bony or joint
space abnormality or appreciable soft tissue swelling. Multiple
surgical clips are seen in the soft tissues medially. Although
there is no definite radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis, if
this is a serious clinical concern, MRI could be considered.

[**2155-5-12**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. Moderate right and small left-sided pleural effusion. Right
lower lung base opacity likely represents associated compressive
atelectasis, however, superimposed pneumonia cannot be
completely excluded and should be considered in the correct
clinical setting.
2. Prominence of left intrahepatic duct and common bile duct is
unchanged
since [**2154-12-22**].
3. Multiple stable bilateral renal cysts.
4. Air in the bladder likely secondary to recent
instrumentation.

[**2155-5-13**]: Chest Xray: In comparison with the study of [**5-9**], there
is little change.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette in a patient with a dual-channel pacemaker device in
place. Blunting of both costophrenic angles persist, though
there is no evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular
congestion. Residual contrast material is seen within the colon.


[**2155-5-13**]: CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial
abnormalities. However, a small acute infarction could be
difficult to detect in the setting of multiple previous chronic
infarctions. If clinically indicated, MRI with and without
contrast would be helpful to detect a new infarction and to
assess for septic emboli.

[**2155-5-13**]: CTA Head/Neck: 1. Hemodynamically significant
atherosclerotic stenosis at the origin of the left vertebral
artery and of the intracranial right vertebral artery.
2. No acute vascular abnormalities of the cervical and
intracranial arteries including no evidence of occlusion,
dissection or aneurysm.
3. For further evaluation of the intracranial structures, please
see
non-enhanced CT of the head from the same date.

[**2155-5-14**]: TEE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium and left atrial appendage but no
mass/thrombus. No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium
or right atrial appendage. Catheter/pacemaker leads are seen in
the right atrium and right ventricle wthout associated
vegetation/thrombus. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch
and descending thoracic aorta. A mechanical aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal disc motion. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen
(may be normal for this prosthesis). The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Well seated mechanical aortic valve with trace aortic
regurgitation. No discrete vegetation identified. Simple plaque
in aortic arch and descending aorta.

[**2155-5-15**] EEG: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to slowing and
disorganization of the background rhythm suggestive of a
moderate encephalopathy. Medications, toxic/metabolic
disturbances, and infections are common causes. No epileptiform
discharges or electrographic seizures were seen during this
recording. Note is made of two narrow QRS complex morphologies
as above.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old Russian-speaking male with history of diastolic CHF,
CAD s/p CABG in [**2137**] and revision in [**2147**], PPM for sick sinus
s/p replacement 6 weeks ago and AS s/p [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] who presented to the
ED with worsening SOB and chest pain x 2 days, found to have
pseudomonas bacteremia.

#. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF with Hypoxic Respiratory
Failure: Patient had hypoxic respiratory in the emergency room.
He was intubated in the ED and transferred to the MICU.  He was
quickly extubated after diuresis.  It was felt that he likely
had an an acute exacerbation of his chronic diastolic CHF in the
setting of bacteremia and severe sepsis.  He was put back on his
home CHF medications and his respiratory status remained stable
post-extubation.  He was placed back on his home CHF regimen
after extubation and had no further respiratory distress.

#. Pseudomonas Bacteremia: His admission blood cultures grew
pan-sensitive pseudomonas.  A source was not identified despite
a thorough workup.  Urinalysis was negative for infection.
Chest xray did not show evidence of pneumonia.  He did have a
moderate right-sided pleural effusion on CT and thoracentesis
was considered but there was not enough effusion to sample.  He
underwent TTE and TEE which showed no evidence of endocarditis.
He did complain of abdominal distension but KUB and abdominal
and pelvic CT did not show any acute intraabdominal pathology.
He did have tenderness at the site of his pacemaker pocket,
tracking down along the anterior chest wall.  Since he had
recently had manipulation of his pacer for replacement, it was
felt this was the most likely source of his infection.  He will
be treated with 4 weeks of IV cefepime and the ID team
recommended subsequent lifelong suppression with oral
ciprofloxacin.  All surveillance cultures were negative and he
remained afebrile after admission.

#. Altered mental status due to possible seizure: One morning,
the patient experienced an episode of altered mental status with
word-finding difficulty, urinary incontinence, and weakness.  He
underwent ECG, ABG, and CXR which were unremarkable and CT head
which showed old CVAs but no acute event.  The neurology team
felt that he may have had a seizure and started the patient on a
zonisamide load.  He should continue this medication as an
outpatient.  We have considered that his lifelong suppression
with ciprofloxacin may lower his seizure threshold, but it was
recommended that he take cipro indefinitely anyway.  He
continued to have word-finding difficulties during the duration
of admission which seemed to wax and wane.

#. Pleural Effusion: He had a moderate right and small
left-sided pleural effusion seen on CT scan.  It was decided to
pursue thoracentesis to rule out this fluid as a source of his
infection.  His Coumadin was held in preparation, and when his
INR was <1.6, the fluid was no longer prominent enough to tap.
His Coumadin was therefore restarted and he will transition on a
heparin drip until therapeutic.

#. CAD: He is status post two coronary bypass procedures with
the most recent one in [**4-/2147**], at which time a revision of
ramus graft was performed.  He was continued on his aspirin,
statin.  His beta blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] were initially held but
restarted prior to discharge.  His Imdur was switched in the
cardiac care unit to twice daily due to possible ST changes on
ECG on admission that may have been demand ischemia.

#. Aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve replacement in
[**4-/2147**] with a #19 St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] prosthesis: He underwent TTE and
TEE that showed a normally functioning prosthesis.  He was
maintained either on a heparin gtt or Coumadin for
anticoagulation with a goal INR of 2.0-2.5 (due to history of GI
bleed). Upon discharge INR was 1.5 and he was on a heparin drip
at 500 units/hour with a PTT of 72.5 at 12:00 PM on [**2155-5-19**].

#. Sick sinus syndrome, status post permanent pacemaker
insertion: It was felt that his pacemaker pocket may have been
infected given the tenderness on palpation.  His pain also
decreased with antibiotics, although chest ultrasound did not
reveal a fluid collection.  He was evaluated by the EP service
who felt conservative management of a possible infection was
reasonable.

#. Chronic atrial fibrillation: He was monitored on telemetry
and given Coumadin for anticoagulation.  Coumadin was held
temporarily due to possible thoracentesis and he was bridged
with a heparin drip.

#. Hyperlipidemia: He was continued on a statin

#. Constipation: He had a persistently distended abdomen and
complained of constipation regularly.  He was kept on an
aggressive bowel regimen and had daily bowel movements.  KUB and
CT abdomen/pelvis showed no obstruction.

#. Code Status: He was DNR/DNI during this hospitalization, as
confirmed by his primary care provider who had had discussions
with the patient prior to hospitalization.  He was intubated
initially in the MICU, but was subsequently made DNR/DNI.

   This patient is a 65 y/o M with history of DMIx35 years (A1c 6.7),
   kidney tx in [**2165**], transferred from [**Hospital3 2089**] ED where he
   presented with fatigue x5 days, worsening edema and mild dyspnea on
   exertion. He was was in the ER to have acute on chronic renal failure
   with a creatinine of 5.6, hyponatremia to 113 and ? PNA on chest Xray.
   Patient reports feeling extremely week for the past 5 days. He c/o
   extreme fatigue preventing him from getting up on his own. he denies
   fevers, chills. he complains of some difficulty breathing and orthopnea
   for the past week. He has been nauseated with dry heave for the past 5
   days. He has also noticed increased scrotal edema x1 month and
   periorbital edema occassionally for the past month. He has had
   worsening LE edema since [**Month (only) 807**] and was started on lasix in the beginning
   of [**Month (only) **]. He reports no change in his urination, denies frequency
   or burning. No changed in the color. His stool has changed, as he goes
   about 3 times a day now, and previously he was constipated. He also
   reports decreased PO intake
   His issues started around last [**Month (only) **] when he had an epsidode of
   vomitting in the setting of 4 days of constipation. This resolved, but
   he remained weak since then. He went to [**State 2090**] for a week at the end
   of [**Month (only) 51**] and that is when he first noticed swelling in his feet. He
   recalls that the swelling has been getting worse slowly since then. He
   finally called his nephrologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2091**] in the middle of [**Month (only) **] who
   scheduled an ECHO and requested him to have his labs drawn. He also
   adjusted the dosages of his Tacro.
   The patient went to [**Hospital3 2089**] [**7-22**] or low blood sugar and again
   [**2177-7-28**] because he was feeling very weak. At that time he was found to
   have low sodium and chloride and low blood count and was given 2 units
   of blood and 2 bags of NS (according to wife). He felt much better
   after this admission, was able to take long walks with his wife, and
   his appetite returned. This last until 5 days ago when he started with
   the above symptoms.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute Renal Failure: Patient with kidney transplant from living related
   donor in [**2165**]. creatinine 4.0 on [**7-30**], now 5.6. Pt appears volume
   overloaded and is possible that he is prerenal secondary to 3rd spacing
   in the settig of kidney failure. FeUrea 63% which is consistent with
   intrinsic renal disease or ATN, both possible in this case. Patient
   fluid overload is likely secondary to renal failure, but may also be
   cardiac, although he denies cardiac history. Got 80mg Lasix IV, put out
   1300. Also considering prerenal in setting of 3rd spacing, but FeUrea
   >50%. Post obstructive also possible with scrotal edema, but has foley
   right now.
   - F/u ECHO from OSH
   - ECHO here
   - Renal transplant team is following
   - will likely require kidney biopsy
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need dialysis, althoug is puttig out well to lasix currently.
   - check urine for casts
   - follow lytes closely in setting of ARF, K normal currently
   - will give 80iv Lasix PRN for goal neg 1-2 L.
   s/p Kidney transplant: renal doctor recent decrease cyclosporine [**Last Name (un) **]
   because of increase in creatinine
   - continue cyclosporine, azathioprine, prednisone
   - will check cyclosporine [**Last Name (un) **] in the AM given recent dose change.
   Hypertensive Emergency: Blood pressure 200/100 in the ED, likely
   because of fluid overload ARF. Responded well to 10mg IV labetolol and
   80mg IV lasix. now BP 140s
   - continue to monitor for now
   - will give either lasix or PRN labetolol if increases again.
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 1: recent A1C [**5-3**].
   - Lantus 5units qAM per home regimen
   - regular ISS
   - hold glyburide
   Hyponatremia: likely in setting of fluid overload. Per note, baseline
   sodium is 120-125. currently 113.
   - diurese as above
   - fluid restriction 750cc
   Pneumonia: CXR suscpicious for PNA, but no wbc count and no fever.
   strange place for loculated effusion
   - will treat for now with levaquin 250mg daily

Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, shortness of breath, edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 65 year old male with history of type 1
diabetes melltius for 35 years (A1c 6.7), kidney transplant in
[**2165**], who was transferred from [**Hospital3 24012**] ED where he
presented with fatigue x5 days, worsening edema and mild dyspnea
on exertion. He was was in the ER to have acute on chronic renal
failure with a creatinine of 5.6, hyponatremia to 113 and
question of PNA on chest Xray.

Patient reports feeling extremely week for the past 5 days. He
complaints of extreme fatigue preventing him from getting up on
his own. he denies fevers, chills. he complains of some
difficulty breathing and orthopnea for the past week. He has
been nauseated with dry heave for the past 5 days. He has also
noticed increased scrotal edema x1 month and periorbital edema
occassionally for the past month. He has had worsening LE edema
since [**Month (only) **] and was started on lasix in the beginning of
[**Month (only) 462**]. He reports no change in his urination, denies
frequency or burning. No changed in the color. His stool has
changed, as he goes about 3 times a day now, and previously he
was constipated. He also reports decreased PO intake

His issues started around last [**Month (only) 547**] when he had an epsidode of
vomitting in the setting of 4 days of constipation. This
resolved, but he remained weak since then. He went to [**State **]
for a week at the end of [**Month (only) 116**] and that is when he first noticed
swelling in his feet. He recalls that the swelling has been
getting worse slowly since then. He finally called his
nephrologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the middle of [**Month (only) **] who scheduled an
ECHO and requested him to have his labs drawn. He also adjusted
the dosages of his Tacro.

The patient went to [**Hospital3 24012**] [**7-22**] or low blood sugar and
again [**2177-7-28**] because he was feeling very weak. At that time he
was found to have low sodium and chloride and low blood count
and was given 2 units of blood and 2 bags of NS (according to
wife). He felt much better after this admission, was able to
take long walks with his wife, and his appetite returned. This
last until 5 days ago when he started with the above symptoms.

In the ED his blood pressure ranged from 151-208/77-106, T 97,
HR 65-79, RR 16 sat 100% RA. He was fiven LEvaquin 750mg IV,
Lasix 80mg IV, labetolol 10mg IV, Compazine 10mg IV. He put out
1300 cc lasix after a foley was placed.

CONCLUSION:

Pulmonary edema, likely cardiogenic. Bibasal effusions.
Increased density at right lung base, confluent edema versus
pneumonia. Followup post diuresis is recomended.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


Renal Ultrasound [**2177-8-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis
within the
transplanted kidney.
2. Slight broadening of the waveform of the mid pole renal
artery,
hoever resistive indices within normal range

Transthoracic Echo [**2177-8-22**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no left
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2170-10-1**], concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy and moderate diastolic dysfunction now
evident.

IMPRESSION: moderate diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle
with normal ejection fraction


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 65 year old male with type one diabetes mellitus,
renal transplant in [**2165**], gastroparesis, who presented with
fatigue, hyponatremia, worsening edema, dyspnea on exertion, and
worsening renal insufficiency who was transferred from an
outside hospital for further management.

Patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. The
nephrology team was consulted and discussed dialysis with the
patient. He refused dialysis, and was able to state the risks
associated with doing so. He understood what dialysis entailed,
and was also not interested in temporary dialysis. It was
recommended that he be treated with trial hypertonic saline to
see if there was improvement in his hyponatremia and energy
level. He refused to stay as an inpatient and declined a PICC
line for administration of hypertonic saline. He was evaluated
by the psychiatry team to help assess whether there was a
component of depression, and to ensure that his mental status
was not clouded by his low sodium. The psychiatry team felt that
the patient was competent and had the capacity to make medical
decisions and fully understood the implications of refusing
dialysis and other treatments. His primary nephrologist
confirmed that this was in accordance with prior discussions
regarding the goals of his care.

The patient stated that his goals were to return home and spend
time with his wife. Social work, palliative care, and case
management were then involved to assist with arranging home
Hospice services to meet the patient's wishes. A Hospice bed was
available for the next day and would be arranged for him in his
home. Per his and his wife's wishes, he was discharged home. A
regimen of salt tabs and lasix was initiated for his
hyponatremia after discussion with the renal team.

His code status is DNR/DNI, and paperwork was completed for his
ambulance ride home for this order.

worsening shortness of breath, or other concerns that need
attention.
.
You should take 80 mg of lasix three times a day in addition to
[**11-27**] salt tabs 3 times a day. Please continue all of your other
medications as directed or appropriate. A foley catheter has
been placed for comfort and should be left in unless otherwise
directed.

13306,188375,6828,"Chief Complaint:  shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling,
   ""dizziness""
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5243**] is a 49 year old male with a PMH of COPD (FEV1 1.7 [**3-16**]), CAD
   s/p IMI, HTN, DMII, OSA on CPAP who presents with increasing shortness
   of breath, dizzyness, and bilateral lower extremity swelling over the
   past 2 weeks. The patient felt like he was fighting a cold 2 weeks ago
   and took Airborne. His symptoms improved, but then he developed a runny
   nose and post nasal drainage and began coughing grey-[**Known lastname **] sputum from
   his lungs. His dyspnea occurs primarily with movement/exertion, not at
   rest. Over this time period he has also developed worsening bilateral
   lower extremity edema that has been painful at times at the ankles. He
   denies any prior history of lower extremity edema. He has also been
   waking up at night sitting up on the side of his bed with his CPAP mask
   off and feeling somewhat confused. He has had a decreased appetite for
   the last 3-4 days with decreased PO intake. He has also felt ""dizzy""
   and when asked to clarify this states that he has felt lightheaded, as
   if he would faint, at times.
   .
   He presented to the [**Hospital 319**] clinic earlier today and was noted to have a
   heart rate of 120 with an 02 sat of 78%. He was sent to the ED for
   further evaluation. Vitals on presentation to the ED were T 99.1, BP
   136/90, HR 100, O2sat of 96% on a non-rebreather mask. He received
   aspirin 325 mg PO, Levofloxacin 750 mg IV, and Lasix 10 mg IV.
   .
   ROS: As above. In addition he also endorses diarrhea yesterday only
   that has since resolved. He chronically sleeps on 2 pillows at night
   and has to sleep on his left side as he cannot breathe if he lays on
   his back. He also uses CPAP at night. He has had no fevers, chills,
   vertigo, headache, chest pain, melena, BRBPR, myalgias, arthralgias, or
   dysuria.

   Imaging: CXR - AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. There
   is
   persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. There is increased
   density at the left lung base which may reflect effusion and
   atelectasis though pneumonia cannot be excluded. Pulmonary vascularity
   is stable allowing for diminished lung volumes with crowding of
   bronchovasculature at the lung bases noted.
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is no overt CHF. No
   pneumothorax is present. Osseous structures are stable.
   IMPRESSION:
   Limited study with increased left basilar density, which may reflect
   atelectasis and effusion though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   Correlation with lateral view may aid in diagnosis.
   [**2192-5-8**] Cardiac cath - 1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant
   system demonstrated an LMCA without angiographically apparent disease.
   The LAD had a 30% proximal lesion. The LCX had a 60% mid-vessel lesion
   just before the patent stent in OM1. The RCA had a 100% proximal lesion
   with very good left to right collaterals.
   2. Pressure wire of the LCX lesion revealed an FFR of 0.81, and the
   lesion was not stented.
   3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures.
   [**2192-4-18**] P-MIBI:
   No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. Nuclear report sent
   separately.
   1. Partially reversible, large, moderate severity perfusion defect
   involving the PDA territory.
   2. Partially reversible, small, moderate severity perfusion defect
   involving the LAD territory.
   3. Increased left ventricular cavity size with normal systolic
   function. Compared with the study of [**2184-5-27**], the defects are new.
   [**2192-3-28**] spirometry - Impression:
   FEV1 1.7(44%), FVC 3.14 (59%), FEV1/FVC 55 (76%)
   Moderate obstructive ventilatory defect. The reduced DLCO suggests a
   perfusion limitation. Compared to the prior study of [**2191-9-13**] the FVC
   has increased by 0.36 L (13%) and the FEV1 has increased by 0.26 L
   (18%).
   [**2191-1-10**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly elongated. Left ventricular
   wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
   (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
   mildly dilated. Free wall motion is depressed (?mild). The aortic valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve is grossly normal. No
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
   hypokineiss. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Preserved global
   left ventricular systolic function. Is there a history to suggest a
   primary pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, COPD,
   bronchospasm, etc.)
   ECG: NSR at 97, RAD. IVCD. TWI in III, TEF in II, aVF. Compared to
   prior [**2192-5-8**], no significant change.
   Assessment and Plan
   49 year old male with COPD (FEV1 1.7 [**3-16**]), CAD, HTN, DMII, OSA on CPAP
   who presents with SOB and LE swelling transferred to the unit for
   hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # respiratory failure: combined hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Etiology unclear.  Chronically elevated Hct suggests some
   level of chronic hypoxia, likely d/t combination of COPD and OSA. pH of
   7.3 with pCO2 of 82 suggests chronic respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic compensation. BL pCO2 likely ~ 70. Unclear cause of current
   decline.  No prodrome of fevers or myalgias to suggest flu. No obvious
   infection on CXR to suggest profound pna. Increased LE edema and
   elevated BNP raises ? of CHF. ? ischemic contribution. MBI elevated but
   ECG without dramatic ischemic changes and trop normal. Could also have
   COPD exacerbation in setting of infection.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia and hypercarbia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 49 year old male with a PMH of HTN, DMII, OSA,
COPD, CAD s/p IMI and stenting who presents with increasing
shortness of breath, dizzyness, and bilateral lower extremity
swelling over the past 2 weeks. The patient felt like he was
fighting a cold 2 weeks ago and took Airborne. His symptoms
improved, but then he developed a runny nose and post nasal
drainage and began coughing grey-[**Known lastname **] sputum from his lungs.
His dyspnea occurs primarilly with movement/exertion, not at
rest. Over this time period he has also developed worsening
bilateral lower extremity edema that has been painful at times
at the ankles. He denies any prior history of lower extremity
edema. He has also been waking up at night sitting up on the
side of his bed with his CPAP mask off and feeling somewhat
confused. He has had a decreased appetite for the last 3-4 days
with decreased PO intake. He has also felt ""dizzy"" and when
asked to clarify this states that he has felt lightheaded, as if
he would faint, at times.
.
He presented to the [**Hospital 191**] clinic earlier today and was noted to
have a heart rate of 120 with an 02 sat of 78%. He was sent to
the ED for further evaluation. Vitals on presentation to the ED
were T 99.1, BP 136/90, HR 100, O2sat of 92% 2L. He received
aspirin 325 mg PO, Levofloxacin 750 mg IV, and Lasix 10 mg IV.
On initial presentation on the floor, the patient was
comfortable, in no distress, able speak and relate history
easily, 92%4L. On falling asleep w/o his usual home BiPap w/ 3L,
he desaturated to 78%RA. He was triggered due to hypoxia. On
arousing the patient up, the patient was awake, alert, not
complaining of SOB, but drowsy. Initially, his O2 sat rose to
89% on 4L. Respiratory therapy was called to arrange for
patient's BiPap. He was also given lasix 20mg IV to which he
promptly urinated 650cc. He also received a combivent. His
clinical status continued to deteriorate with 02 sat 80-85% on
10L. ABG was 7.42/90/45. He was placed on CPAP and transfered to
the ICU.
.
ROS: As above. In addition he also endorses diarrhea yesterday
only that has since resolved. He chronically sleeps on 2 pillows
at night and has to sleep on his left side as he cannot breathe
if he lays on his back. He also uses CPAP at night. He has had
no fevers, chills, vertigo, headache, chest pain, melena, BRBPR,
myalgias, arthralgias, or dysuria.

.
EKG ([**2193-1-8**]): Sinus rhythm at the upper limits of normal rate.
Right inferior axis. RSR' pattern in lead V1. Borderline
intraventricular conduction delay. Low precordial voltage. Since
the previous tracing of [**2192-5-8**] the inferior Q waves are less
prominent now. Early precordial ST segment elevations are no
longer present. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
CXR ([**2193-1-8**]): Limited study with increased left basilar
density, which may reflect atelectasis and effusion though
pneumonia cannot be excluded. Correlation with lateral view may
aid in diagnosis.
.
CXR ([**2193-1-9**]): In comparison with the study of [**1-8**], there is
again blunting of the left costophrenic angle with opacification
at the base. Again, there is asymmetry of the density of the
lungs with the left being somewhat darker. Mild prominence of
interstitial markings persists that could represent some
asymmetric pulmonary edema.
.
TTE ([**2193-1-9**]): The left atrium is dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's
body habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricleappears mildly dilated and hypokinetic. No
pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic pressure hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year old male with COPD (FEV1 1.7 [**3-16**]), CAD, HTN, DMII, OSA
on CPAP who presents with SOB and LE swelling transferred to the
unit for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
Respiratory failure: Transferred from floor to ICU for combined
hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. Etiology unclear
but likely a combination of chronic lung disease and mild CHF.
Chronically elevated Hct suggested chronic hypoxia, likely due
to a combination of COPD and OSA. pH of 7.3 with pCO2 of 82
suggests chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic
compensation. BL pCO2 likely ~ 70. No obvious infection on CXR
to suggest pna. Increased LE edema and elevated BNP raised
possibility of CHF. He ruled out for acute MI and TTE was
limited but LV function was thought to be normal with mild RV
dilation and hypokinesis. He initially required noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation which was weaned off on hospital
day #2. He was treated for COPD exacerbation with IV solumedrol
which was transitioned to oral prednisone on hospital day # 3.
He received levofloxacin for possible atypical pneumonia for a 5
day course. He was continued on his home Advair and received
albuterol and atrovent nebulizers. He diuresed well with IV
lasix.  He remained relatively hypoxic requiring 5L via nasal
cannula to maintain O2 sats in the 90s and required noninvasive
mechanical ventilation overnight to maintain oxygenation. Both
bipap and noninvasive cpap were used during his stay however the
patient could not tolerate bipap despite trying on different
masks. He preferred to stay on O2 NC which at 5L maintained O2
saturations from mid 80s to low 90s. It was felt the patient
would benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation and at the patient's
preference he was given contact information to schedule this as
an outpatient. The patient was newly started on furosemide 10mg
daily. He was counselled to weigh himself daily, call his PCP
for any weight increase >3lbs and to adhere to a low salt diet.
The patient ambulated with PT the day prior to discharge and
maintained an oxygen saturation of >90% on oxygen, 4L by NC.
.
Dizziness/lightheadedness: Unclear cause. Potentially due to
significant hypoxia as was in 70s on RA at outpt appointment on
admission. He had no further symptoms throughout his
hospitalization. No arrhythmias on telemetry. Symptoms did not
recur during his stay.
.
Erythrocytosis. The patient was found to have profound
erythrocytosis to Hct of 60. He was evaluated by the heme-onc
consult service who felt this most likely represented secondary
polycythemia due to chronic hypoxia. Epo level was sent and is
pending at the time of discharge. Due to the marked elevation in
Hct, the patient was felt to be at risk for symptoms associated
with his condition. He was initiated on phlebotomy and underwent
1U removal with Hct decline to 57. He will follow-up in the
hematology clinics for ongoing care of this issue including
ongoing phlebotomy with likely goal Hct 55. It is possible
though unlikely that the patient will experience hypoxia
associated with this loss in oxygen carrying capacity.
.
Diabetes: well controlled according to most recent HbA1C. On
metformin as outpt. Metformin was held during admission and he
was controlled with insulin sliding scale. He was restarted on
metformin prior to discharge.
.
Hypertension: Patient was normotensive throughout admission with
low normal SBPs in 90s with sleep.  He was continued on his home
regimen of lisinopril and metoprolol.
.
CAD: s/p IMI in past by report and prior stenting. Large
reversible defect in inferior wall in [**3-16**] but no intervenable
CAD on cath in [**5-15**]. No chest pain on history and he ruled out
for MI with serial enzymes. He was continued on asa, statin,
beta blocker, and ace inhibitor.
.
Diastolic heart failure. As described above, the patient was
confirmed on TTE to have diastolic heart failure. He was started
on simvastatin for this issue as well his history of CAD.
.
OSA: As above, required noninvasive mechanical ventilation
overnight to maintain oxygenation.
.
Code: The patient is full code.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and
you were found to have low oxygen levels. You were given
diuretics (water pills) to help remove fluid from your lungs and
you were given steroids and antibiotics for an exacerbation of
your COPD.  You improved with these treatments but continued to
require supplemental oxygen at night while sleeping. You do not
need to continue use of your CPAP machine at night. Please
follow-up with with your primary care doctor and your
pulmonologist for further care of this issue.
.
You were also found to have extremely high blood counts. This is
likely due to chronic low oxygen levels in the blood. You must
follow-up in the hematology clinics as scheduled for ongoing
care of this issue including regular blood removal.
.

   Chief Complaint:  [**Hospital 3353**] transfer from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 250**] ED
   HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 347**] is a 70 y/o female with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%),
   T2DM, HTN, and hypothyroidism who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 250**] ED with 2
   days of worsening dyspnea and chest pain. Pt also reported 2-3 days of
   intermitttent, diffuse back pain.
   .
   Upon arrival to the ED, vitals were BP 164/77, HR 92, RR 34, 71% O2 sat
   on RA. She reported 1-2 days of worsening dyspnea and [**11-12**] SSCP, no
   radiation or associated symptoms. Sats improved to 100% on NRB. She was
   given 1 SL nitro, which decreased her CP to [**6-12**] but also dropped her
   BP to 83/42. EKG without any acute ST changes, evidence of AV pacing.
   She was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 with marked improvement in her
   symptoms and able to wean her oxygen to 4L NC, satting 98%. Foley was
   placed. CXR reportedly revealed pulmonary edema but report did not
   accompany patient. She was given another 40 mg of IV Lasix. She was
   also given ASA 325 mg. The decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] CCU
   for further diuresis in the setting of hypotension.
   .
   Upon arrival to the CCU, she was in NAD and hemodynmically stable. BP
   was 106/54 and HR 72, satting 100% on 4L NC, quickly weaned to 2L NC.
   She still complained of [**5-13**] chest pain.
   .
   Upon further questioning, she explained that there were no recent
   changes in her medication regimen. She admits to using salt on her food
   but not a large amount. Followed by a cardiologist at [**Location (un) 2544**]-[**Location (un) 3354**].
   She saw him about 3 weeks ago and per her report no changes were made
   to her medications. Denies F/C. Denies N/V/D/abdominal pain. Denies
   urinary symptoms. Denies palpitations or PND. Usually sleeps at an
   incline so difficult to know if orthopnea worsened. No recent travel.
   ROS otherwise N/C. Of note, pt is a poor historian.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 F with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (EF 20% in [**6-10**]), T2DM, HTN, and
   hypothyrodism who presents with worsening DOE and chest pain.
   .
   # DYSPNEA -  Basilar crackles, JVD, OSH CXR with volume o/l, and
   elevated BNP suggest symptoms are [**3-6**] CHF exacerbation.  Given chest
   pain and hypotension might also represent cardiac ischemia.  No
   suspicion of PE at this time. Outpatient PFTs show mild restrictive
   pattern but no COPD.  No evidence for right-sided failure on exam.  1L
   negative at OSH with 40 mg IV Lasix x 2. Unclear what precipitated
   exacerbation, DDx includes ischemia, medication noncompliance, or
   dietary indiscretion.
   - serial EKGs, cycle CEs, continue telemetry
   - Lasix gtt for now given SBPs in the 90s-100s for further removal of
   fluid, continue Foley for now with goal UOP >60 cc/hr as tolerated by
   blood pressure.  Goal 1-2L diuresis.
   - half dose BB, hold ACEI
   - continue amiodarone
   - repeat chest x-ray here
   - touch base with outpatient cardiologist/PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: changes in meds, last
   TTE/cath/interrogation of pacer, what type of pacer
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - no evidence of suggest PNA or other etiology for pt's symptoms
   - once BP improves, will add back ACEI
   - Echo to evaluate EF.
   .
   # CHEST PAIN - [**Month (only) 51**] be ischemic as improved with NTG, however no
   convincing evidence of ACS by EKG or troponins.
   - SL NTG or morphine if BPs tolerate.
   - cycle CEs, serial EKGs, monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypotension - Likely has low pressures as outpatient given low EF but
   will be limiting to diuresis.  At OSH had SBP of 160 on presentation.
   - Hold outpatient betablocker and lisinopril for now, gentle diuresis
   with Lasix gtt
   .
   # CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE - Baseline creatine around 2, 1.9 at OSH.
   - renally dose meds.  Trend Cr.
   .
   # LUMBAR BACK PAIN - Has been going for two days and is improved now.
   Exam consistent with MSK etiology, no abnormalities on exam.
   - Tylenol for pain control
   .
   # T2 DIABETES - On insulin at home with glargine 10-20 mg daily.
   - start at 10 mg glargine with humalog ss.
   - monitor FSBG

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 y/o female with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF
20%), T2DM, HTN, and hypothyroidism who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
ED with 2 days of worsening dyspnea and chest pain. Pt also
reported 2-3 days of intermitttent, diffuse back pain.

Upon arrival to the ED, vitals were BP 164/77, HR 92, RR 34, 71%
O2 sat on RA. She reported 1-2 days of worsening dyspnea and
[**11-12**] SSCP, no radiation or associated symptoms. Sats improved
to 100% on NRB. She was given 1 SL nitro, which decreased her CP
to [**6-12**] but also dropped her BP to 83/42. EKG without any acute
ST changes. There was AV pacing. She was given Lasix 40 mg IV x
1 with marked improvement in her symptoms and able to wean her
oxygen to 4L NC, satting 98%. Foley was placed. CXR reportedly
revealed pulmonary edema but report did not accompany patient.
She was given another 40 mg of IV Lasix. She was also given ASA
325 mg. The decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for
further diuresis in the setting of hypotension.

Upon arrival to the CCU, she was in NAD and hemodynmically
stable. BP was 106/54 and HR 72, satting 100% on 4L NC, quickly
weaned to 2L NC. She still complained of [**5-13**] chest pain.

Upon further questioning, she explained that there were no
recent changes in her medication regimen. She admits to using
salt on her food but not a large amount. Followed by a
cardiologist at [**Location (un) 745**]-[**Location (un) 3678**]. She had recently had a course
of steroids for gout flare which was perhaps responsible for
fluid retention. Denies F/C. Denies N/V/D/abdominal pain. Denies
urinary symptoms. Denies palpitations or PND. Usually sleeps at
an incline so difficult to know if orthopnea worsened. No recent
travel. ROS otherwise N/C. Of note, pt is a poor historian.

ECHO [**12-10**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20%). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is at
least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with elevated LVEDP. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation. At least mild pulmonary hypertension.

CXR [**12-10**]:
1. Right basilar area of consolidation concerning for pneumonia
or
aspiration. Left basilar atelectasis.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly.
3. No sign of failure or effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital1 18**] EKG:
Mostly V-paced, occasional PVCs, no acute ST changes,

70 F with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (EF 20% in [**6-10**]), T2DM, HTN,
and hypothyrodism who presents with worsening DOE and chest
pain.

# DYSPNEA - On transfer, in the setting of pt's history, exam
(basilar crackles, JVD) and laboratory findings (OSH CXR with
volume overload, and elevated BNP), etiology of pt's dyspnea was
thought to be secondary to left sided CHF exacerbacion. Etiology
of exacerbation was thought to be partly dietary indiscretion
and more importantly a recent course of prednisone. Pt was
diuresed aggresively with IV lasix drip. CXR confirmed fluid
overload and ruled out infection. BP meds were held while
diuresing and restarted once tolerated. Pt's oxygen
supplementation was weaned as she was diuresed.

# CHEST PAIN - Not thought to be ischemic based on EKG and
cardiac enzymes.

# Hypotension - Thought to be chronic due to low EF. Pt's
beta-blocker and ace-inhibitor were initially held while
aggresively diuresing and restarted slowly prior to discharge.

# CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE - Pt's creatinine fluctuated around her
baseline with diuresis. She was asked to have her renal function
checked on follow up with PCP.

# DIABETES type 2 - Pt's blood sugars were controlled with
standing glarging and humalog sliding scale.

# HYPOTHYROIDISM - Pt's TSH was elevated and repeated due to
concern for contribution to CHF, but T3 and T4 were within
appropriate range, thus suggesting sick euthyroid. She was
continued on her outpt dose of levothyroxine.

# ARRHYTHMIA - Pt initially had frequent ectopy with PVCs
alternating with paced beats. Her PVCs were not perfusing and
thus her effective pulse was 40s while being paced at 70s. Pt
remained asymptomatic but EP was consulted and recommended
increasing beta-blockade to suppress ectopy. On discharge pt's
perfusing pulse was in the 70s on Toprol.

   who presents s/p seizures at home. Patient is Spanish speaking only so
   most of history obtained from his wife and some from patient as well.
   .
   Patient says he drinks vodka but says he last drink was Monday (6 days
   prior to presentation). His wife confirms she believes this is true.
   She reports that she came home from work yesterday and the patient had
   a black eye on the right which he told her was from a fall. He also may
   have vomited yesterday although this history is not clear. Then today
   she and her daughter witnessed him seizing. Whole body shaking with all
   limbs moving. No loss of bowel or bladder continence. Lasted about one
   min then stopped. Then started again for another min. She reports he
   was confused and did not know who she was afterwards. She called EMS to
   bring him to the ED. She reports he had this about 6 months ago and was
   told it was from alcohol use. She also reports that he has not been
   eating well secondary to his esophageal stricture which was recently
   dilated by GI here.
   .
   In the ED, his initial vital signs were T 98.7, BP 131/80, HR 86, RR
   18, O2sat 100% RA. He was given potassium, magnesium, banana bag and
   ativan per CIWA scale (about 6-8mg total). Neurology was consulted in
   the ED as well. He had a trauma work up for CT c-spine, head and
   maxillary/mandible all of which were negative for fracture. CXR was
   unchanged with no acute process. He was sent to the ICU for further
   care.

   .
   # alcohol abuse: long history of alcohol abuse.
   -thiamine, folate, MVI
   -SW consult/addiction consult
   -PPI
   .
   # elevated bilirubin: likely secondary to underlying liver disease from
   alcohol. He has elevated bili (mild) and mild thrombocytopenia and
   anemia.
   .
   # liver nodules: follow up as outpatient. In [**Month (only) **] it was recommended
   that he have an MRI given suggestion of liver nodule vs HCC.He had MRI
   in [**10-1**] which showed hemangioma and no suggestion of HCC.
   .
   # esophageal stricture: recently dilated by GI as outpatient. Will need
   outpatient follow up. His EGD in [**10-1**] suggested lesion on distal
   esophagus. Biopsy just showed inflammation. Unclear if this was
   followed further.

History of Present Illness:
56 yo M with PMH of alcohol abuse and alcohol withdrawal
seizures who presents s/p seizures at home. Patient is Spanish
speaking only so most of history obtained from his wife and some
from patient as well.
.
Patient says he drinks vodka but says he last drink was Monday
(6 days prior to presentation). His wife confirms she believes
this is true. She reports that she came home from work yesterday
and the patient had a black eye on the right which he told her
was from a fall. He also may have vomited yesterday although
this history is not clear. Then today she and her daughter
witnessed him seizing. Whole body shaking with all limbs moving.
No loss of bowel or bladder continence. Lasted about one min
then stopped. Then started again for another min. She reports he
was confused and did not know who she was afterwards. She called
EMS to bring him to the ED. She reports he had this about 6
months ago and was told it was from alcohol use. She also
reports that he has not been eating well secondary to his
esophageal stricture which was recently dilated by GI here.
.
In the ED, his initial vital signs were T 98.7, BP 131/80, HR
86, RR 18, O2sat 100% RA. He was given potassium, magnesium,
banana bag and ativan per CIWA scale (about 6-8mg total).
Neurology was consulted in the ED as well. He had a trauma work
up for CT c-spine, head and maxillary/mandible all of which were
negative for fracture. CXR was unchanged with no acute process.
He was sent to the ICU for further care.

.
Head CT [**2103-12-16**]: The study is limited due to motion artifact.
There is no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of
normally midline structures, major vascular territorial infarct,
or intracranial hemorrhage.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The study is limited due to motion
artifact for the evaluation of the orbits; however, no displaced
fracture is identified. There is a large right periorbital
hematoma. The ocular globes appear intact.
.
CT Mandible, Sinus [**2103-12-16**]: The cribriform plate appears
intact. The nasal septum is mildly deviated to the right. There
is a small air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus. No
acute fracture is identified. Right periorbital soft tissue
hematoma is seen.
.
CT C-Spine [**2103-12-16**]: There is no prevertebral soft tissue
swelling. The
alignment is maintained without spondylolisthesis. No acute
fracture is
identified. The odontoid process is intact. Multilevel
degenerative changes, worse at the level of C5-6 and C6-7. The
visualized lung apices demonstrate a left apical bleb. Bilateral
apical pleural thickening. The visualized paranasal sinuses
demonstrate minimal opacification of the right maxillary sinus.
Soft tissue density in both external auditory canals may
represent cerumen. Clinical correlation is recommended.
.
Chest X-ray [**2103-12-16**]: 1. Small nodular opacities within the left
mid lung field, which were present on the previous chest CT, may
be slightly improved. Findings may represent small airways
infection or aspiration.
2. Post-surgical changes, right lung.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. SEIZURES
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the MICU after having 2 witnessed
seizures in the setting of alcohol withdrawal.  He said that it
had been 6 days since his last drink and had a history of
seizures 6 months prior in the setting of alcohol withdrawal.
His ETOH level was negative on tox screen.  Neurology was
consulted in the ED and recommended and outpatient EEG.  He was
put on a CIWA protocol and given Diazepam PO to treat his
withdrawal.  He required IV Ativan initially to control his
symptoms but then was given PO Diazepam.  His withdrawal
sytmptoms were controlled and he had no witness seizures during
this hospital stay.  He was given thiamine, folate and a
multivitamin and was put on a PPI.  He was transferred to the
medicine floor on [**2103-12-19**].  He continued to have no seizures
for the remainder of his hospital course.  He was scheduled for
outpatient neurology follow-up and will be called by the EEG lab
regarding scheduling of an outpatient EEG.
.
2. ALCOHOL ABUSE
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was given IV Ativan initially for withdrawal and this
was later changed to PO Diazepam.  He required no further
benzodiazepines after [**2103-12-19**].  He was seen by the addiction
social worker who suggested inpatient rehab program but he
preferred to seek help at outpatient treatment centers and was
given a list of programs prior to discharge.  He was advised not
to drink alcohol.  His liver function tests were normal through
his hospital course.
.
3. DYSPHAGIA
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a history of dysphagia and prior EGDs with
dilation.  Several prior biopsies had shown no evidence of
cancer.  On admission he stated that he had dysphagia to thick
meats such as steak.  He was evaluated by a barium swallow study
which showed hold-up of a 13mm barium tablet but no hold-up of
the liquid barium and no diverticulum.  His outpatient
gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and suggested
outpatient follow-up for this problem with another EGD and
possibe sugerical referral in the future.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was given
an appointment to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] in [**Month (only) 404**].  He was evaluated by
speech and swallow who stated that he had no difficulty in
swallowing above the epiglottis.  He was advised not to eat
steak and to seek medical attension if he had pain with
swallowing or the feeling of food getting stuck in his throat.
He was advised to seek medical attention if he could not
maintain his weight properly with foods.
.
4. PROPHYLAXIS
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was put on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis, a PPI and a
bowel regimen during his hospital course.  He was given a
prescription for a PPI as an outpatient.
.
Prior to discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by PT who
recommended outpatient PT for [**2-25**] more days and ambulation with
a cane, as the patient was not entirely steady on his feet.

EGD Biopsy:
DIAGNOSIS:
""Gastroesophageal junction stricture"" biopsy:

1)  Focal ulcer of squamous epithelium with granulation tissue.

2)  Cardiac-type mucosa without intestinal metaplasia.

3)  No viral inclusions or tumor seen.
.
CXR:
IMPRESSION: Interval development of opacification within the
left lower lobe that is suggestive of aspiration.
.

EKG [**2-7**]:
Sinus rhythm. Probably a normal tracing but baseline artifact
makes
assessment difficult. Since the previous tracing of [**2104-2-4**]
sinus
tachycardia is absent and ST-T wave changes have decreased.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 year-old male with alcoholism and history of withdrawal
seizures who presented after s/sx alcohol withdrawal including
seizure on [**2104-2-4**] with admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], 3 days after most
recent drink. Treated with valim po and iv per CIWA scale (note
high benzo doses during this time period with valium 30mg given
on this ciwa scale). Patient also became acutely hypoxic after
likley aspiration event and briefly required a non-rebreather
while being transfered to floor with plan prior to treat for
aspiration PNA. Completed 7 day course of levo/flagyl.
.
# PNA, aspiration:
Had fever to 102, no leukocytosis, though infiltrate on CXR,
with suspected aspiration PNA upon transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Pt was
initially treated with Vanc and Levo, and he completed treatment
for aspiration pneumonia with levo/flagyl.  Pt remained afebrile
after treatment, and without respiratory complaints.

# Alcohol withdrawal/Etoh dependency:
Patient was admitted with withdrawal seizure, initially
monitored closely in ICU with valium 30 mg PO Q1 hour with CIWA
checks. He received a total of 280 mg of valium. Patient cleared
from withdrawal within the hospital.
- contin thiamine, folate and MVI as an outpatient
.
# Esophageal stricture: During his hospital stay the patient had
an episode of a soft piece of [**Country 1073**] getting stuck in his lower
esophagus. Thankfully it eventually passed. the GI team was
contacated and they took him for EGD the following day. His
lower esophagus was succesfully dilated. His diet was advanced
back to soft after that and he tolerateed it well. He is
followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 174**] for his stricture. He recommended
an outpatient [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2963**] which will be arranged by his team.
.

# Orthostatic hypotension: The patient was noted to have
orthostatic hypotension during his hospitalization. His BP did
respond to IVF although he did not appear clinically dehydrated.
The patient may have autonomic neuropathy, likely due to alcohol
abuse. A cosyntropin stim test was within normal limits. Pt was
started on florinef.
- contin florinef as an outpt
.
# Anemia: Hct remained stable. Likely ETOH related.
.

# Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia: repleted as necessary.
Stabilized and did not require further repletion by the end of
the hospitalization.

.
FEN: recommend soft solids d/t hx of stricture

 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   30 F with seizure disorder, EtOH abuse who presents after a seizure and
   found to have hyponatremia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Hypoosmotic.  DDx includes poor PO intake due to
   stress, primary polydypsia, or less likely SIADH or reset osmostat.
   Was intially given 1.5 L NS in ED with rapid correction of Na to 130.
   Unclear if ataxic gait in ED may be [**1-1**] to demyelination or lorazempam
   effect.  Patient arrived somnolent, but still with 5/5 strength and
   able to be arroused.
   - Na Checks Q4-6 hrs
   - Hold IVF for now as she has rapidly corrected in first 3 hrs.
   - measure urine osms and lytes
   - TSH
   - neuro checks Q2 hrs
   - treat seizures as below.
   - re-image head if mental status deteriorates
   .
   # Seizures: One withnessed in ED with gaze deviation. Multiple possible
   causes of seizures including hyponatremia, medication non-compliance,
   and EtOH withdrawal.  Recieved several doses of ativan in ED but more
   related to anxiety and desire to leave rather than be admitted.
   - Appreciate Neuro recs
   - Seizure precautions for any acute seizure activity, 2 mg IV lorazepam
   - Loaded with Keppra 1 gm IV,
   - 500 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold trileptal and f/u level sent in ED
   - treat hyponatremia as above
   .
   # EtOH Abuse: Patient states she has been drinking more often due to
   stress in her life.  Last drink PM of [**2131-6-9**]. Unclear if withdrawal is
   contributing to siezures, but currently without
   tachycardia/hypertension or other signs of withdrawal.
   - Check LFTs
   - Social work consult for substance abuse treatment.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: likely related to ketosis with ketones in urine.
   - monitor with hydration and re-feeding.
   .
   # Anxiety: Patient initially refusing admission to MICU due to
   ""personal problems"".  [**Name2 (NI) **] staff noted her to be very anxious.
   - Hold clonazepam 0.5mg TID PRN as patient is somnolent

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I have seen and examined the patient with the resident and agree with
   the assessment and plan as above with the following emphasis/addendum:
   31 year old female history of seizure disorder, ETOH abuse, who
   presented to the ED after having a seizure.  In the ED, she had a
   second seizure and was given lorazepam.  She was found to be
   hyponatremic (124) and was given normal saline.  Neurology had
   evaluated the patient and were concerned that seizures were secondary
   to hyponatremia.  Patient was loaded with Keppra.  During ED course,
   patient refusing to stay but ultimately agreed to admission
 had
   received additional ativan for anxiety and possible withdrawal and
   currently she is sleepy and unable to provide further history.
   PE:  T 36.7     BP 144/84    P 82     R 20     O2 Saturation: 98% RA
   Gen: sleepy but arousable, conversant briefly, and protecting airway
   Chest: CTA bilaterally
   Cor: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: soft NT ND
   Ext: no edema
   Neuro: Arousable with verbal stimuli
moves all extremities and no focal
   neuro findings although limited exam given her lethargy that is likely
   secondary to benzodiazepams.
   Labs:
   Na 124 -> 130 -> 137
   Alcohol: negative
   Bicarb: 20
   Ketones in urine
   HCT: Negative
   1: Seizure: differential includes seizure related to alcohol
   withdrawal, hyponatremia (less likely given that level was 124 in
   chronic alcoholic but still possible), medication non-compliance,
   primary seizure disorder
   - loaded with Keppra and given ativan in the ED
   - Neurology following and will continue Keppra
   2: Hyponatremia: essentially corrected on arrival to ICU
 correction
   was quick so will monitor mental status when she awakes to make sure
   there are no signs of CPM though unlikely given level of 124.  Will not
   provide any further correction given level is currently 137.  Etiology
   likely secondary to alcohol (beer potomania), dehydration (hypovolemic,
   hyponatremia), or polydipsia.  Other etiologies less likely but if
   recurs, can investigate.
   3- Alcoholism:
   - Monitor for signs of withdrawal and CIWA as needed
   - thiamine, folate, and B-vitamins
   Time Spent: 35 minutes (patient is critically ill)

Brief Hospital Course:
30 F with seizure disorder, EtOH abuse who presents after a
seizure and found to have hyponatremia.
.
# Hyponatremia: Hypoosmotic. Likely [**1-1**] decreased po intake,
primary polydipsia on trileptal (can also be primary effect of
drug itself), with possible component from beer potomania (few
beers daily). Less likely [**1-1**] EtOH withdrawal. CXR and TSH nl.
Trileptal discontinued. Was intially given 1.5 L NS in ED with
rapid correction of Na to 130 and subsequently to 139 with no
further intervention. Ataxic gait in ED likely [**1-1**] lorazepam
effect rather than demyelination as neuro exam remained intact
and ambulating well on discharge.
.
# Seizures: One witnessed in the ED with gaze deviation. Has
underlying seizure d/o with this episode likely in the setting
of hyponatremia, likely medication
noncompliance, and alcohol use. Seen by Neuro who recommended
discontinuing Trileptal and loading with keppra, then
discharging on once daily dosing of Keppra XR 2000mg. Counseled
against EtOH abuse and instructed not to drive for 6 months. Pt
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tomorrow ([**2131-6-12**]). If her
anxiety worsens while on Keppra, could consider transitioning to
long acting Lamictal as an outpatient.
*Trileptal level pending on discharge.*
.
# EtOH Abuse: Patient states she has been drinking more often
due to stress in her life, at least 2-4 beers daily. Last drink
PM of [**2131-6-9**]. Did not appear to be in EtOH withdrawal. Did
receive banana bag. Counseled against EtOH use and discharged on
daily MVI.
.
# Anion gap acidosis: Likely related to ketosis given ketonuria.
Improved in AM after hydration and reinitiation of po diet.
.
# Anxiety: Patient initially refusing admission to MICU due to
""personal problems"".  [**Name2 (NI) **] staff noted her to be very anxious and
received ativan there. Discharged on home clonazepam 0.5mg TID
PRN.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
Hyponatremia, possibly secondary to primary polydypsia
Seizure disorder


Discharge Condition:
good, hemodynamically stable, no neural deficits.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for seizure and found to have a low sodium
level. This is thought to be due to multiple factors including
possible side effect of trileptal, increased water intake with
decreased food intake, or possibly increase intake of beer,
which has no sodium.  The lower sodium puts you at risk for more
frequent seizures.   Your sodium corrected rapidly without any
neurologic problems.  [**Name (NI) **] were given Keppra to prevent seizures
in the future.
.
Due to the fact that you had a seizure, you may NOT drive for 6
months. Please see your neurologist tomorrow as described below.
.
Medication changes:
- Please STOP taking trileptal
- Please take 1 tab of Keppra 500 mg tonight ([**2131-6-11**]), then
start Keppra XR
- Please take Keppra XR as prescribed.
- Please take a multivitamin daily
- Please take your other medications as prescribed.

   Imaging: .
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
   [**2192-10-29**]:  The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
   dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) with global near akinesis. No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is
   no ventricular septal defect. with depressed free wall contractility.
   The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   leaflets are not well seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
   suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
   pressure. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
   signs of tamponade.
   .
   CXR [**2191-12-24**] (prelim read): limited by portable technique, poor
   penetration. Heart is quite enlarged but stable in size. Prominence of
   pulmonary vasculary which may be accentuated by low lung volumes.
   Retrocardiac consolidation with atelectasis. No pleural effusion on the
   right; however effusion on the left cannot be excluded.  Impression:
   cardiomegaly with volume overload; retrocardiac atelectasis.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10185**] is a 24 year old man with a history of non-ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, NYH Class II CHF, EF 15-20% who presents with acute on
   chronic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   1. Acute on Chronic CHF Exacerbation: Underlying etiology was presumed
   to be viral in origin.  All lab testing negative, including HIV, EBV,
   CMV, Lyme, RPR.  Current exacerbation due to poor compliance as patient
   does not weigh himself.  Appears to be taking medications as prescribed
   and does not report missing any doses.  No current evidence of ischemic
   event.
   - will continue diuresis with Lasix, additional 40mg IV now
   - monitor Is/Os; goal negative 1-2 liters/day
   - electrolyte repletion
   - fluid restrict 2000ml
   - continue b-blockade with Toprol XL 75mg PO BID per Dr.[**Name (NI) 10186**] note
   - continue rule out with cardiac enzymes
   - full dose aspirin for LV thrombus prevention
   - continue Digoxin, will re-load due to low Digoxin level with 0.5mg X
   1, then 0.25mg
   - ECG in AM
   .
   2. Tachycardia: Sinus rhythm.  Per prior records, this is likely
   chronic.  CHF exacerbation may be contributing.
   - continue home dose of Metoprolol for sinus tachycardia
   .
   3. Leukocytosis: No evidence of infection based on exam.  Appears
   chronic compared to prior levels.  Likely stress response.
   - continue to monitor

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32362**] is a 24 year old man with a history of non-ischemic
cardiomypathy (EF 15-20%) and morbid obesity who presents with
shortness of breath, lower extremity edema and abdominal
distention for the past 2 weeks. He states that on the day of
admission ([**2191-12-24**]) he felt short of breath and a chest tightness
described as ""pulling"" sensation in the center of his chest,
worse with deep inspiration. He reports decreased expercise

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32362**] is a 24 year old man with a history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy, NYH Class II CHF, EF 15-20% who presents with
DOE/SOB over one month, acutely over one week. He was treated
for acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. He was diuresed with IV
and then PO lasix, achieving a net negative balance of ~ 7
litres. He was discharged to optimize his fluid status prior to
an AICD placement

By Problem
1. Acute on Chronic CHF Exacerbation: Underlying etiology for
patient's chronic heart failure was presumed to be viral in
origin, could also be related to cocaine use in years prior to
diagnosis or alcohol abuse.  All lab testing negative except for
RSV, including HIV, EBV, CMV, Lyme, RPR.  Current exacerbation
likely due to poor dietary compliance as patient does not weigh
himself daily and could easily become overloaded particularly in
the context of the Holidays.  He denied any medication
noncompliance.  The patient was aggressively diuresed with iV
furosemide and by time of discharge he was 7 litres net negative
and sent home on 40 mg of PO furosemide [**Hospital1 **].

2. Tachycardia: The patient had CHF with rates around 100-130 at
presentation.  This appears to be a chronic problem per previous
notes.  This improved somewhat with diuresis and improvement of
his respiratory status. Doses of metoprolol were increased over
hospitalization without change in heart rate (100-120 on
telemetry).  The patient should have an AICD for purposes of
primary prevention given his low EF.  Plans are underway to
finish this as an outpatient.  He was discharged on 100 mg
Toprol XL [**Hospital1 **]

3. Iron Deficiency Anemia: The patient continued to be
microcytic with indices suggestive of iron deficiency. He is
also hemoglobin AC which could explain some microcytosis. No
signs of active bleeding and previous CT [**Last Name (un) **] was negative. He
was discharged on iron TID with ascorbic acid for absorption and
senna/colace for constipation

4: Hyperbilirubinemia/ Liver Dysfunction: Patient had a slightly
elevated INR and bilirubin at presentation with normal
transaminases.  Both of these parameters were slightly above his
previous values though he doe have a known element of
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (defined by ALT/AST and US/CT
evidence of fatty infiltration). Given his two presumptive
diagnoses (NAFLD/NASH and Congestive Hepatolpathy) he is at
increased risk of fibrosis. His negative transaminases and
elevated bilirubin (half direct, half indirect) were likely in
the setting of hepatic congestion and decreased cardiac output
during his heart failure exacerbation. His bilirubin was
elevated at the time of discharge, but this would not be
expected to fall quickly. It ought to be followed.

5. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient was mildly hypoxic at
presentation presumably due to exacerbation of his CHF. With
diuresis this improved.  ULtimately, plan is for outpatient
right heart cath.  The patient was also encouraged to use his
CPAP at home and continue the diuresis begun in house.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient had a mild leukocytosis that was
trending down at the time of discharge.  He had no fevers or
signs of acute infection.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr [**Known lastname 32362**], it was pleasure to participate in your care. You were
admitted because you had increased swelling in your legs and
difficulty breathing.  This was due to an exacerbation of your
heart failure.  The reasons for this exacerbation are unclear
though it may have been partially driven by more salty food over
the Holidays or more subtle diet changes.   In the hospital you
received IV diuretics to help remove this fluid. You lost more
than 7 litres of fluid by the time you were discharged. This is
more than 15 pounds! It is crucial that you continue this
progress at home by being very careful with diet, fluid intake
and medication use.

Your medications have been changed.  You have been started on
iron supplementation as your low iron seems to be contributing
to your persistently low blood counts. Take your iron pills with
vitamin c or fruit juice. If you get constipated on iron, you
can take Colace twice daily or Senna; these are medications that
you can get at the pharmacy. Please continue to take your other
medications as previously described.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

MEDICATIONS
1) LASIX/FUROSEMIDE - Take 40mg tablets in the morning when you
wake and again at 4pm, or a few hours before you go to sleep.
You must take it twice daily. Your cardiologist may change this
dose. You must follow up with your PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] lab test while on
this dose
2) Toprol XL - 100 mg, twice daily - this is a new dose of your
heart rate medication. TAKE THIS MEDICATION TONIGHT.
3) Aspirin 325 mg, this is to prevent a clot in your heart
4) Iron, Vitamin C - you are very low on iron and vitamin c aids
in absorption
5) Colace and Senna - medications for constipation, if that
becomes an issue


Followup Instructions:
You need to have your labs checked at your PCP office
We have scheduled an appointment for monday

   [**2192-12-23**] - [**2192-12-26**] with acute congestive heart failure in the setting of
   dietary non-compliance. He was scheduled to have his AICD placed today
   under general anesthesia per recommendation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2363**]. Per
   anesthesia, patient was a difficult intubation due to his body habitus,
   and was maintained on a phenylephrine gtt in order to maintain his
   blood pressures during the procedure (SBPs in 100s-120s). He underwent
   RHC which showed elevated wedge, PA, RV, and RA pressures (see
   hemodynamics below). He had a [**Company **] single chamber ICD

   was continued on a neo gtt which was weaned at 5 pm, and remained off
   pressors for 4 hours prior to CCU transfer. Patient was transitioned to
   PS [**9-29**] in an attempt at extubation in the PACU, but these attempts
   were unsuccessful due to tachypnea and secretions requring continuous
   secretions. Patient was also noted to be difficult to sedate during
   ventilation and was maintained on propofol 70 mcg/kg/min. A-lines
   attempts in both radial arteries by anesthesia were unsuccessful. It
   was thought that the failure to extubate was due to body habitus and
   pulmonary edema. Prior to transfer to CCU, VS were 98.6 112/48 110 20
   100% on CPAP with PEEP of 10 and FiO2 of 50%. He received 20 mg of IV
   lasix in the PACU and was transferred to the CCU for further
   management.

   LABORATORY DATA:
   7.36/49/111/29
   Na:139 K:4.1 Cl:101 Glu:81 O2Sat: 96
   Imaging: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
   is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
   normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %)
   with global near akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. with depressed free wall contractility. The diameters of
   aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
   not well seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
   restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   .
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-6-6**], no
   change. The LVEF was overestimated on the prior study.
   ECG: EKG: sinus tachycardia. +LAD. normal intervals; poor R-wave
   progression precordial leads. no acute ischemic changes.
   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIOMYOPATHY, OTHER
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p cardiac catherization. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary
   restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung
   compliance due to volume overload from patient's systolic and diastolic
   heart failure, leading to elevated elastic pressures. ABG shows chronic
   respiratory acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, may be
   due to obesity hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome.
   - initial diuresis with lasix gtt (40 mg IV bolus x1), but held in the
   setting of hypotension
   - propofol for sedation
   - consider checking P-plateau to assess for elastic pressures
   - switch to AC overnight
   - wean ventilator as tolerated after diuresis with attempt at
   extubation in AM
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 in the ED and rising leukocytosis. Likely
   febrile in setting of recent procedure. Hypotension, although more
   likely due to sedation/intubation is somewhat concerning for possible
   sepsis.
   - check WBC diff
   - blood cultures
   - u/a, urine cultures
   - CXR
   - tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - minimize lines
   - IV abx for ICD placement (see below)
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. Placement of
   A-line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating relative hypotension. Etiologies
   include sedation/mechanical ventilation versus sepsis given recent
   diagnosis of cellulitis treated with 10 days of keflex, fever noted on
   CCU admission, hypotension, and decreased urine output.
   - neo gtt run peripherally for MAP > 65
   - hold lasix gtt
   - hold placement of CVL for now given possible extubation in AM; will
   place if pressor requirements increase.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - check  c. diff toxin assay
   - consider broadening abx to Vancomycin if spikes fever again.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cre up to 1.7 (baseline 1.1). [**Month (only) 11**] be pre-renal
   in setting of hypotension during the procedure due to
   sedation/intubation, leading to ATN (intrarenal). Other etiologies
   (though less likely) include poor forward flow in setting of depressed
   EF% versus overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. No recent contrast
   administration. Patient relatively oliguric on admission to the CCU
   with only 40 ccs of dark urine output to 20 of IV lasix administered in
   the PACU.
   - bladder scan to assess for post renal obstruction
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - check digoxin level in AM to avoid toxicity
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - check u/a, urine electrolytes to calculate FeUrea, urine eos
   - consider renal consult in AM if renal failure worsens
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] in setting acute renal failure
   .
   # PUMP: Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, thought to be viral in
   etiology. Likely has chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF
   25% on [**9-28**].) Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC
   today with severe pulmonary hypertension. Patient received lasix 20 mg
   IV x1 in PACU and 40 IV x1 in CCU followed by lasix gtt, which was then
   held in the setting of hypotension noted on A-line readings, which were
   ~20 pts lower than non-invasive readings.
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - fluid restriction, low Na diet, strict Is and Os, foley, daily
   weights
   - continue BB, digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 25%. One
   episode of NSVT in the CCU.
   - CXR in AM to confirm AICD placement
   - EP to interrogate pacer in AM
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue beta-blocker and digoxin
   - check digoxin level in AM
   - IV Ancef x1, followed by Keflex x3 days to prevent infection s/p AICD
   placement
   .
   # Asthma:
   - albuterol inhaler prn
   .
   # Fatty Liver: Patient sedated with propofol overnight given quick
   on/off for sedation. Patient received fentanyl and versed but was
   reportedly not well sedated during the procedure on this regimen,
   resulting in switch to propofol. Per discussion with pharmacy, OK to
   sedate with propofol temporarily overnight (12 hours) if extubation
   planned in AM.
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia. Trend Hct. Continue iron
   supplements with bowel regimen and vitamin C once able to take PO.
   .
   # OSA: restart/encourage nocturnal CPAP at home once extubated.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32362**] is a 24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 25%
in [**9-28**]) who was admitted for right heart cardiac catherization
and AICD placement today. He is being transferred to the CCU
after difficulty with extubation s/p cath. Patient was recently
admitted to the CCU from [**2192-12-23**] - [**2192-12-26**] with acute congestive
heart failure in the setting of dietary non-compliance. He was
scheduled to have his AICD placed today under general anesthesia
per recommendation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Per anesthesia, patient was a
difficult intubation due to his body habitus, and was maintained
on a phenylephrine gtt in order to maintain his blood pressures
during the procedure (SBPs in 100s-120s). He underwent RHC which
showed elevated wedge, PA, RV, and RA pressures (see
hemodynamics below). He had a [**Company 2267**] single chamber
ICD placed through cutdown of left cephalic vein without
complication. Received 1.2 L of LR in the OR. He was continued
on a neo gtt which was weaned at 5 pm, and remained off pressors
for 4 hours prior to CCU transfer. Patient was transitioned to
PS [**9-29**] in an attempt at extubation in the PACU, but these
attempts were unsuccessful due to tachypnea and secretions
requring continuous secretions. Patient was also noted to be
difficult to sedate during ventilation and was maintained on
propofol 70 mcg/kg/min. A-lines attempts in both radial arteries
by anesthesia were unsuccessful. It was thought that the failure
to extubate was due to body habitus and pulmonary edema. Prior
to transfer to CCU, VS were 98.6 112/48 110 20 100% on CPAP with
PEEP of 10 and FiO2 of 50%. He received 20 mg of IV lasix in the
PACU and was transferred to the CCU for further management.

and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes consistent with multifocal

pneumonia, and echocardiography showed moderate to severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %), with
normal valve function, and no pericardial effusion. Lab work
for RSV was positive, while HIV, influenza, EBV, CMV, Lyme and
multiple blood cultures were unremarkable. Repeated echo 10
months later confirms severely depressed and dilated LV with
LVEF of [**10-4**]%, and LVEDD of 7.8 cm
- last hospitalized [**5-29**] and [**12-30**] for CHF exacerbation, treated
with IV lasix
2. Childhood asthma
3. Morbid obesity
4. Sleep apnea - on CPAP but has not been using it
5. Moderate, Worsening pulmonary hypertension (46 mmHg [**9-28**])
(20-28 in [**4-28**])
6. Fatty Liver by CT. Obese and hx of EtOH. INR 1.4-1.7 since
[**5-29**]; Bili 1.7; HCV neg; HBV immune.

He is unmarried and lives at home with his parents. He works as
a high school wrestling coach and in security. He never smoked.
He drank ""a lot"" in college, previously quoting 6 beer/weekend
but not elaborting this time; started drinking in [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32363**]
high school. He has a history of cocaine use, ""a great deal"" in
sophmore year. Drinks an occasional glass of wine.

Family History:
Father is 65 year-old and mother is 55 year-old.
Both have diabetes. He has 4 healthy older sisters. There is no
family history of SCD or cardiomyopathy.

Left: DP 2+ PT 2+

Discharge exam: vitals stable
pulmonary exam: clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Otherwise unchanged.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**1-8**]: In comparison with the study of [**12-23**], there is again
huge
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary
vascular
congestion. It is difficult to determine whether there are
layering
effusions, because of extensive scattered radiation related to
the body
habitus of the patient. The ICD line is poorly seen, though it
appears to
extend to the region of the apex of the right ventricle.

CXR [**1-9**]: In comparison with the study of [**1-8**], there are very
low lung
volumes. Huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.
Pulmonary
vessels are difficult to evaluate, though they do not appear to
be especially engorged. The AICD line extends to the region of
the apex of the right ventricle. The area behind the hugely
enlarged heart cannot be evaluated for the possible presence of
pneumonia or effusion.

AP CHEST, 8:24 A.M. [**1-19**]

HISTORY: Intubated. Multilobar collapse or infection, assess
change.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-15**] and 28.

Severe cardiomegaly has improved since [**1-15**], subsequently
stable.
Previous mild pulmonary edema has also improved, though
pulmonary vascular
engorgement remains. Left lower lobe is consolidated, but has
probably
improved since [**1-15**] and since there was previously ipsilateral
mediastinal
shift much of that is probably atelectasis. The course of the
transvenous
right ventricular pacemaker lead is obscured in the heart by
cardiac motion.

[**2193-1-18**] CT chest/[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis

Final Report
INDICATION: 24-year-old man with persistent fever after ICD
placement. Study
is to evaluate for source of infection.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired from the thoracic inlet
through the
pubic symphysis without administration of IV contrast.
Multiplanar
reformatted images were provided, essential in delineating
anatomy and
pathology.

CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is complete collapse of the
left lower lobe
and partial collapse of right lower lobe, with an endotracheal
tube in place.
This probably represent atelectasis, although underlying
infection cannot be
excluded particularly in the setting of fever and leukocytosis.
Examination
of fine parenchymal detail or small nodules is severely limited
by motion
artifact as well as image quality. There is no pericardial or
pleural
effusion.

Visualization of the thyroid gland is limited by motion,
however, a small
hypodensity with central hyperattenuation is seen in the
posterior left lobe
of the thyroid (2, 3), measuring approximately 8 mm. There is
moderate-to-
severe cardiomegaly. Patient is status post a left-sided ICD
placement with
metallic leads terminating in the right atrium and right
ventricle. Small
mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for
pathologic
enlargement.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: A nasogastric tube is in place with
its tip
terminating in mid stomach. Small amorphous echogenic material
layering along
the posterior fundal stomach probably represents ingested
material. Within
limitation of non-contrast technique, the liver, spleen, adrenal
glands, and
kidneys appear unremarkable. The gallbladder is not visualized.
A 2cm
hypodense area in the head of pancreas (2,73; 103b,41) may
represent a cyst.
There is no nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis. There is no free
air or free
fluid. A few small focal areas of soft tissue thickening in the
right
abdominal adipose tissue are of uncertain etiology, for example,
series 2,
image 87.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The bladder is decompressed with a
Foley catheter
which is in place. The rectum and sigmoid colon are collapsed.
Uterus is not
well seen. A 12mm right iliac lymph node is noted (2, 118),
non-specific.
Additional small scattered inguinal and pelvic sidewall lymph
nodes do not
meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. There is no free
fluid in the
pelvis.

OSSEOUS FINDINGS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube in place with complete and partial collapse
of left and
right lower lobes probably represent atelectasis. However,
underlying
infection cannot be excluded given clinical presentation.

2. No fluid collection or abscess identified in the abdomen or
pelvis.

3. 8-mm left thyroid cyst or nodule can be further evaluated by
ultrasound.

4. 2-cm hypoattenuating area in pancreatic head may represent a
cyst.
Further evaluation as clinically indicated.

5. Cardiomegaly with ICD in place.

6. Isolated 12mm right iliac lymph node is non-specific.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.



Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after
failure to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart
cath. This failure was related to pulmonary edema, pneumonia
(serratia) and atelectasis. Over 10 days of ventillation, the
patient's I/O's were 8 L negative. In this time he had a
swan-ganz catheter placed and a myocardial biopsy. His course
was complicated by fevers which may have been related to
atelecatisis or a drug reaction (he had a bilateral blanching
erythematous rash) and/or serratia in his sputum. He was
extubated and swiftly transferred to the floor. He was
discharged to rehab______

#. Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in
the PACU s/p ICD placement. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary
restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung
compliance due to volume overload from patient's systolic and
diastolic heart failure, leading to elevated elastic pressures.
Mr. [**Known lastname 32362**] required 8 litres of measured diuresis and an
antibiotic course over 10 days to become suitable for extubation
(he was, until that point, hypercarbic on pressure support).
Pulmonary was consulted. A Chest CT on the day before extubation
highlighted atelecatasis. After extubation, he saturated at
91-94% on room air.
.
#. Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy: His EF is 10% or less.
This is the indication for his ICD placement. Etiology thought
to be related to obesity, post-viral or related to distant
history drug use. A myocardial biopsy was unrevealing. His has
chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure. He required
invasive monitoring (SGC) and lasix, metolazone, diamox diuresis
to 8 measured litres negative. He will need a transplant work
up. He was discharged on metoprolol, [**Last Name (un) **], digoxin, lasix and
eplerinone.
.
#. Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 in the PACU and rising
leukocytosis. Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure. He
also had a bilateral, blanching, confluent erythematous rash
from his toes to umbillicus that gradually fades. His urine was
positive for Eosinophils. Blood cultures with coag negative
staph. C Diff negative. His Fever waxed and waned, peaking at
104.0 on ventillator day 8. He was placed under a cooling
blanket and given round-the-clock tylenol. A CT chest
underscored atelectasis but could not rule out pna. He slowly
defervesced while on antibiotics, so he continued on a full
course for VAP.
.
#. Acute renal failure:  Mr. [**Known lastname 32362**] had two episodes of ARF. On
admission his Cr was up to 1.7 (baseline 1.1), which was likely
related to hypotension intraoperatively. This resolved. Later,
as his diuresis reached goal, his creatinine bumped to 2.4.
Renal was consulted and felt this was related to diuresis and
[**Last Name (un) **] therapy. This too resolved. During the workup, he was found
to have urine eos.
.
#. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Patient had hyperbilirubinemia to 2.7
with direct fraction of 2.0. When previously admitted for CHF
exacerbation, he had bilirubin elevations to 2.0. This is likely
related to congestive hepatopathy. As he diureses, these numbers
improve. He received an unremarkable RUQ US which commented on
the non-visualization of his gallbladder, which cannot be seen
on his CT's. This has not been confirmed by any direct
visualization. His CT abdomen this admission described a normal
appearing liver, while a prior exam described fatty infiltration
with nodularity.
.
#. Anemia, Microcytic:  Mr. [**Known lastname 32362**] has Known iron deficiency
anemia s/p normal CT colonography. He has hemorrhoids and HbAC
(benign but gives microcytosis). He was maintained on iron with
vitamin C.

# Asthma:  It is the reason he wasn't started on carvedilol.
Patient states he had childhood asthma, and hasn't had asthma
symptoms since high school.  Albuterol inhaler prn was given.

#. OSA: Patient would benefit from CPAP, but he refused CPAP
here in the hospital after extubation.

   and poor PO intake.
   .
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] team was called for evaluation on [**2178-9-24**] after patient had
   episode of hematemesis. Patient reports that she was sleeping and awoke
   with substernal chest discomfort. Shortly thereafter, she vomitted
   approximately 150 cc of bright red bloody emesis. She was noted to be
   slightly tachycardic with a heart rate to the 110's. Of note, her
   platelet count was 19,000 on morning of hematemesis. The moonlighter
   discussed the patient with her oncology attending; it was felt that
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] was appropriate given that her short term
   prognosis was felt to be favorable. OMED moonlighter initiated IV
   PPI/H2 blocker, transfusion of 2 units of platelets, morphine for pain
   control, and stat laboratories to check CBC and coags. An EKG
   demonstrated ST elevation in aVR/V1.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8317**] is 69 year old with history of esophageal cancer and
   breast, currently undergoing Cycle 2 of therapy with cisplatin and 5-FU
   as well as radiation therapy, who is transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   hematemesis.
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Suspect this is likely due to radiation esophagitis
   coupled with mucositis due to chemotherapy leading to
   [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]-like tears with heaving. In setting of thrombocytopenia,
   this is a set-up for hematemesis. This would fit with her substernal
   discomfort that accompanied the episode. Other possibilities include
   peptic ulcer disease, bleeding from malignancy, vascular malformation,
   fistula, among other causes.
   - Continue IV BID PPI, H2 blocker
   - Getting 2 units of platelets now, will follow up post-transfusion
   counts, transfuse to goal of 30 K if possible
   - Follow up HCT now, q6-8 hours
   - Access: PIV and port in place
   - GI cockail
   - Pain control with morphine
   - Anti-emetics PRN
   - If [**Last Name (LF) 8318**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] discuss if any other potential treatment options are
   appropriate with GI aside from supportive care, as unsure what role
   upper endoscopy would have
   - Checking coagulation studies
   - NPO for now with maintenance IVF
   - Adding on cardiac enzymes, follow up EKG
   .
   #) Esophageal cancer, breast cancer: Currently on cycle 2 of therapy;
   this is her expected nadir of counts.
   - Continue supportive transfusions as needed (HCT goal >25, Plt >30)
   - Appreciate oncology recommendations
   - Pain control and anti-emetics PRN
   .
   #) Neutropenia: Expected as counts nadir.
   Continue to monitor for fever and initiate antibiotics as appropriate
   - Follow ANC
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Neupogen 300 mcg per oncology recommendations
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI/H2 blocker, holding heparin given thrombocytopenia
   .
   #) FEN: NPO for now, IVF for maintenance, replete electrolytes PRN
   .
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   Glycemic Control: Insulin sliding scale if needed
   Lines:
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no heparin SQ given bleeding and low counts
   DVT: Pneumoboots
   Stress ulcer:
   VAP:
   Comments:
   Communication:  Comments:
   Code status: Full
   Disposition: ICU for now, though if remains hemodynamically stable and
   no further episodes, would consider transfer back to floor

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo woman with ho Stage III esophogeal carcinoma on day 6 of
cycle 2 of cisplatin/5-FU, presents with nausea, fatigue, poor
PO intake.

# Esophagitis: Patient with signicant esophagitis. In setting of
radiation tx, thrombocytopenia, pt vomitted 150cc of frank
bloody emesis and was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation. Pt was
transfused 1 unit PRBCs and 3 units platelets and an EGD showed
erosive esophagitis, likely radiation induced. Patient's
dysphagia improved with iv pantoprazole.

# Pancytopenia: Pt with severe thrombocytopenia requiring
multiple transfusions of platelets, PRBCs, and was started on
neupogen which resolved her neutropenia. Patient remained
afebrile.

# Nausea: Most likely combination of cisplatinum chemotoxicity
causing central nausea along with constipation possibly induced
by narcotics and zofran. Pt is afebrile and without other sx or
signs of infection. Nausea was refractory and severe and needed
standing Zofran 8 mg IV Q8H, Prochlorperazine 10 mg IV Q6H and
Reglan with eventual resolution. Patient's nausea required
nighttime doses which also helped her AM nausea.

# CP: Most likely caused by esophogitis given association with
eating and resolution with GI coctail. EKG normal. Pt with
modified Well's score of 1 and low risk for PE. Cardiac enzymes
negative. Continued home GI coctail with good effect.

# Dehydration: Most likely due to poor PO intake mostly related
to chemotoxicity and dysphagia and probable component of
esophogeal malignancy. Pt on IVF, and this was eventually weaned
off once PO intake improved.

# Constipation: Likely related to morphine and zofran. Resolved
with aggressive bowel regimen.

# Hypokalemia/Hypomagnesemia: Persisted despite resolution of
nausea/vomitting, likely secondary to chemotoxicity. Pt
instructed to return to clinic within the week to check lytes.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to take care of you during your
hospitalization.

You were admitted to the hospital for nausea, vomitting, and
dehydration due to chemotoxicity. You continued to receive
radiation to your esophagus during your hospital stay. You
developed bloody vomitus and an upper GI scope revealed severe
esophagitis secondary to radiation injury. Your blood counts
also suffered from the chemotherapy. We gave you platelets, red
blood cells, and neupogen to stimulate your bone marrow to make
neutrophils, an important white blood cell. Over time your cell
counts stabilized. Fortunately, your ability to swallow, nausea,
and vomitting improved throughout your hospital stay and you
were able to take in sufficient oral intake. You also had a
slightly fast heart rate. A medicaiton, Atenolol, was started to
control your heart rate. You also had low potassium. Please take
potassium as it perscribed below. You are to be discharged to
home with home VNA services following.

We have made the following changes to your medications:
1) Potassium tablet 20mEQ by mouth every day for 7 days or until
you see your oncologist.
2) Atenolol 25mg by mouth every day.
3) Bisacody 10mg by mouth every day as needed for constipation
4) Lactulose  30mL every 8 hours as needed for constipation
4) Ondansetron ODT 8mg by mouth every 8 hours for nausea
5) Prochlorperazine 10mg by mouthe very 6 hours for nausea
6) Metoclopramide 10mg by mouth four times a day with meals and
at bedtime for nausea

If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, high fevers,
please come to the emergency department.

ECHO
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior
wall and apex. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild focal LV systolic dysfunction, consistent with CAD (LAD
territory). No significant valvular abnormality seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief this a 72 year old man with CAD, HTN and hyperlipidemia
who presented with STEMI and noted to have stenosis of the LAD.
He is status post thrombectomy and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**]. He remained
hemodynamically stable during and post procedure. His post MI
TTE showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior wall and apex and
an EF of 40%. He remained in sinus rhythm during his stay. His
medical regimen on discharge inludes ASA, clopidrogel,
simvastatin, lisinopril and metoprolol. He should be on
clopidrogel for at least one year post stent. NSAIDs should be
avoided to prevent interaction with ASA. He has a history of
myopathy related to statins - he developed hand pain during
hospitalization on Atorvastatin 80mg, so he was switched to
Simvastatin 20mg prior to discharge.

#. GI Bleed: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by
UGIB on [**12-17**]. He was noted to have HCT drop to 29.7, in
addition to black stool, guaiac positive. He was transfused 1
unit pRBCs with appropriate response in HCT. He declined upper
endoscopy during this hospitalization and preferred to f/u with
his GI physician as an outpatient. HCT was stable upon discharge
at 31.6 with no further evidence of bleeding. He was discharged
on PPI [**Hospital1 **].

#. Gouty flare: The patient developed pain in his toes during
his hospitalization. He was started on colchicine prior to
discharge. NSAIDs should be avoided to prevent interaction with
ASA, as well as in the setting of recent GI bleed.
